Introduction\\n\\n    On May 9, 2019, we proposed amendments \\\\4\\\\ to the ``accelerated \\nfiler'' and ``large accelerated filer'' definitions in Rule 12b-2.\\\\5\\\\ \\nWe proposed these amendments to promote capital formation for certain \\nsmaller issuers while maintaining investor protections by more \\nappropriately tailoring the types of issuers that are included in the \\ncategories of accelerated and large accelerated filers and revising the \\ntransition thresholds for accelerated and large accelerated filers. \\nSpecifically, we proposed to exclude from the accelerated and large \\naccelerated filer definitions an issuer that is eligible to be a \\nsmaller reporting company (``SRC'') \\\\6\\\\ and that has annual revenue of \\nless than $100 million in the most recent fiscal year for which audited \\nfinancial statements are available (``SRC revenue test''), with the \\neffect that such an issuer would not need to satisfy the requirements \\napplicable to an accelerated or large accelerated filer. We also \\nproposed to increase the public float transition threshold for \\naccelerated and large accelerated filers to become a non-accelerated \\nfiler from $50 million to $60 million, and to increase the exit \\nthreshold in the large accelerated filer transition provision from $500 \\nmillion to $560 million in public float. Finally, we proposed to add a \\nrevenue test to the transition thresholds for exiting both accelerated \\nand large accelerated filer status.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Amendments to the Accelerated and Large Accelerated Filer \\nDefinitions, Release No. 34-85814 (May 9, 2019) [84 FR 24876 (May \\n29, 2019)] (``Proposing Release'').\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Although Rule 12b-2 defines the terms ``accelerated filer'' \\nand ``large accelerated filer,'' it does not define the term ``non-\\naccelerated filer.'' If an issuer does not meet the definition of \\naccelerated filer or large accelerated filer, it is considered a \\nnon-accelerated filer.\\n    \\\\6\\\\ See Item 10(f), Rule 405, and Rule 12b-2 (defining SRC).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We received over 60 comment letters on the proposal, including over \\n40 unique letters and approximately 20 letters that were substantially \\nsimilar. Many of the commenters generally supported the proposed \\namendments \\\\7\\\\ while other commenters generally opposed them or \\nsuggested the need for further empirical study.\\\\8\\\\ In addition, the \\nSEC's Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee (``SBCFAC'') \\nadopted a recommendation supporting the proposed amendments,\\\\9\\\\ and the \\n2019 SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation \\n(``SEC Small Business Forum'') provided a recommendation on the \\naccelerated filer definition.\\\\10\\\\ After taking into consideration these \\nrecommendations and the public comments, we are adopting the amendments \\nsubstantially as proposed. The final amendments are consistent with our \\nhistorical practice of providing scaled disclosure and other \\naccommodations for smaller issuers and with recent actions by Congress \\nto reduce unnecessary burdens on new and smaller issuers.\\\\11\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\7\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Comm'n Small Bus. Capital Formation \\nAdvisory Comm., Recommendation on the Commission's Proposal to Amend \\nthe Accelerated and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions (Aug. 23, \\n2019) (``SBCFAC Recommendations''), available at \\nhttps://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/recommendations-rule-3-05-and-accelerated-filer-definition.pdf\\n. Although it supported the proposed \\namendments, the SBCFAC stated that it ``would welcome the Commission \\nto explore additional further amendments'' to the accelerated and \\nlarge accelerated filer definitions and recommended exploring \\nraising the revenue threshold to be a non-accelerated filer to one \\nhigher than $100 million, basing the revenue test for an issuer to \\nqualify as a non-accelerated filer on a three-year rolling average \\ninstead of basing it on the revenue in the most recent fiscal year, \\nand looking at whether all SRCs should be non-accelerated filers.\\n    \\\\10\\\\ See U.S. Sec. and Exch. Comm'n Gov't-Bus. Forum on Small \\nBus. Capital Formation, Report on the 38th Annual Government-\\nBusiness Forum on Small Business Capital Formation (Aug. 14, 2019) \\n(``SEC Small Business Forum''), available at \\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/small-business-forum-report-2019.pdf\\n. The SEC Small Business \\nForum recommended aligning the definition of non-accelerated filer \\nwith the definition of SRC to include issuers with a public float \\nless than $250 million or with annual revenues less than $100 \\nmillion (and either no public float or a public float less than $700 \\nmillion).\\n    \\\\11\\\\ For example, Title I of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups \\nAct of 2012 (``JOBS Act'') amended Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-\\nOxley Act (``SOX''), 15 U.S.C. 7262(b), which relates to an issuer's \\nICFR to exempt emerging growth companies (``EGCs'') from the \\nrequirement of SOX Section 404(b). In particular, SOX Section 404(b) \\nrequires that an issuer's independent auditor attest to, and report \\non, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the issuer's \\nICFR (``ICFR auditor attestation''). See Public Law 112-106, Sec. \\n103, 126 Stat. 306 (2012). In addition, Section 72002 of the Fixing \\nAmerica's Surface Transportation Act of 2015 requires the Commission \\nto revise Regulation S-K to further scale or eliminate requirements \\nto reduce the burden on EGCs, accelerated filers, SRCs, and other \\nsmaller issuers, while still providing all material information to \\ninvestors. See Public Law 114-94, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nII. Discussion of the Final Amendments\\n\\nA. Background\\n\\n    In June 2018, the Commission adopted amendments \\\\12\\\\ to the SRC\\n\\n[[Page 17180]]\\n\\ndefinition \\\\13\\\\ to expand the number of issuers that qualify for scaled \\ndisclosure accommodations. The amended SRC definition allows an issuer \\nto use either a public float \\\\14\\\\ test or the SRC revenue test to \\ndetermine whether it is an SRC. The amendments increased the threshold \\nin the public float test for an issuer to initially qualify as an SRC \\nfrom less than $75 million to less than $250 million.\\\\15\\\\ The \\nCommission also expanded the revenue test to include issuers with \\nannual revenues \\\\16\\\\ of less than $100 million if they have no public \\nfloat or a public float of less than $700 million.\\\\17\\\\ The Commission \\nintended the amendments to promote capital formation for smaller \\nissuers by reducing compliance costs for the newly eligible SRCs while \\nmaintaining appropriate investor protections.\\\\18\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\12\\\\ See Smaller Reporting Company Definition, Release No. 33-\\n10513 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 31992 (July 10, 2018)] (``SRC Adopting \\nRelease'').\\n    \\\\13\\\\ See note 6 above.\\n    \\\\14\\\\ Public float is defined in paragraph (3)(i)(A) of the SRC \\ndefinition in Rule 12b-2, which states that public float is measured \\nas of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed \\nsecond fiscal quarter and computed by multiplying the aggregate \\nworldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common \\nequity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common \\nequity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of \\ncommon equity, in the principal market for the common equity. See \\nalso Item 10(f) (2)(i)(A) and Rule 405. An entity with no public \\nfloat because, for example, it has equity securities outstanding but \\nis not trading in any public trading market would not be able to \\nqualify on the basis of a public float test alone. That entity must \\nlook to the SRC revenue test to determine whether it qualifies as an \\nSRC.\\n    \\\\15\\\\ To avoid situations where an issuer frequently enters and \\nexits SRC status, each test includes two thresholds--one for \\ninitially determining whether an issuer qualifies as an SRC and a \\nsubsequent transition threshold that is lower for issuers that did \\nnot initially qualify as an SRC, or that no longer qualify as an SRC \\nbecause they exceeded the initial thresholds.\\n    \\\\16\\\\ Annual revenues are measured as of the most recently \\ncompleted fiscal year for which audited financial statements are \\navailable. See Item 10(f)(2)(i)(B), Rule 405, and Rule 12b-2.\\n    \\\\17\\\\ See Item 10(f)(1), Rule 405, and Rule 12b-2. The prior \\nrevenue test included issuers with no public float and annual \\nrevenues of less than $50 million. See SRC Adopting Release, note 12 \\nabove, at 31995. The lower transition thresholds under the revenue \\ntest for an issuer that did not initially qualify as an SRC, or that \\nno longer qualifies as an SRC because it exceeded the initial \\nthresholds, were revised from less than $40 million of annual \\nrevenues and no public float to less than $80 million of annual \\nrevenues and either no public float or a public float of less than \\n$560 million. See Item 10(f)(2)(iii)(B), Rule 405, and Rule 12b-2.\\n    \\\\18\\\\ SRC Adopting Release, note 12 above, at 31992.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In conjunction with these amendments, the Commission also revised \\nthe accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions in Rule \\n12b-2 to remove the condition that, for an issuer to be an accelerated \\nfiler or a large accelerated filer, it must not be eligible to use the \\nSRC accommodations.\\\\19\\\\ One result of these amendments is that some \\nissuers now are categorized as both SRCs and accelerated or large \\naccelerated filers.\\\\20\\\\ These issuers have some, but not all, of the \\nbenefits of scaled regulation. In particular, issuers that are \\ncategorized as both SRCs and accelerated or large accelerated filers \\nmust comply with the earlier filing deadlines required of accelerated \\nand large accelerated filers for annual and quarterly reports and the \\nrequirement of SOX Section 404(b).\\\\21\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\19\\\\ This amendment, among other things, preserved the existing \\nthresholds in those definitions and did not change the number of \\nissuers subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\n    \\\\20\\\\ Although rare, under our existing rules, some issuers that \\nmeet the large accelerated filer definition may be eligible to be an \\nSRC because of the expanded revenue test in the SRC definition. See \\nProposing Release, note 4 above, at 24877, n. 25. As discussed \\nbelow, in Section II.B.3., we are adopting the proposed amendment to \\nthe ``large accelerated filer'' definition so that an issuer that is \\neligible to be an SRC under the SRC revenue test would not also \\nqualify as a large accelerated filer.\\n    \\\\21\\\\ 15 U.S.C. 7262(b).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Prior to the SRC amendments, the SRC category of filers generally \\ndid not overlap with either the accelerated or large accelerated filer \\ncategories.\\\\22\\\\ Now, however, as illustrated in Figure 1 of this \\nsection, because the public float tests in the SRC and accelerated \\nfiler definitions partially overlap, and the accelerated and large \\naccelerated filer definitions no longer specifically exclude an issuer \\nthat is eligible to be an SRC, an issuer meeting the accelerated filer \\ndefinition will be both an SRC and an accelerated filer \\\\23\\\\ if it has:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\22\\\\ See SRC Adopting Release, note 12 above, at 32001.\\n    \\\\23\\\\ The thresholds provided below are based on the initial \\nthresholds of each definition; however, due to the transition \\nprovisions of the accelerated and large accelerated filer \\ndefinitions, additional issuers may also be both an SRC and an \\naccelerated or large accelerated filer.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\n A public float of $75 million or more, but less than $250 \\nmillion, regardless of annual revenues; or\\n    \\n Less than $100 million in annual revenues, and a public \\nfloat of $250 million or more, but less than $700 million.\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MR20.000\\n\\nB. Amendments To Exclude Low-Revenue SRCs From the Accelerated and \\nLarge Accelerated Filer Definitions\\n\\n1. Proposed Amendments\\n    Under the existing accelerated filer and large accelerated filer \\ndefinitions in Rule 12b-2, an issuer must satisfy three conditions to \\nbe an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer.\\\\24\\\\ We proposed to\\n\\n[[Page 17181]]\\n\\nadd a new condition to the definitions of accelerated filer and large \\naccelerated filer that would exclude from those definitions an issuer \\nthat is eligible to be an SRC and that meets the SRC revenue test. The \\nmost notable effect of the proposed amendments \\\\25\\\\ would be that an \\nissuer that is eligible to be an SRC and that meets the SRC revenue \\ntest would not be subject to the requirement of SOX Section 404(b) that \\nan issuer's independent auditor must attest to, and report on, \\nmanagement's assessment of the effectiveness of the issuer's ICFR.\\\\26\\\\ \\nThe final amendments do not change an auditor's role in a financial \\nstatement audit.\\\\27\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\24\\\\ The three existing conditions for qualifying as an \\naccelerated filer are that an issuer: (1) Had an aggregate worldwide \\npublic float of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, as \\nof the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed \\nsecond fiscal quarter; (2) has been subject to the requirements of \\n15 U.S.C. 78m (Exchange Act Section 13(a)) or 15 U.S.C. 78o(d) \\n(Exchange Act Section 15(d)) for a period of at least twelve \\ncalendar months; and (3) has filed at least one annual report \\npursuant to those sections. For a large accelerated filer, \\nconditions (2) and (3) are the same, but condition (1) is that an \\nissuer had an aggregate worldwide public float of $700 million or \\nmore, as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently \\ncompleted second fiscal quarter. Also, as discussed in note 20 \\nabove, some issuers that meet the ``large accelerated filer'' \\ndefinition may be eligible to be an SRC.\\n    \\\\25\\\\ The issuer also would not have to abide by the filing \\ndeadlines of an accelerated or large accelerated filer, provide the \\ndisclosure required by Item 1B of Form 10-K and Item 4A of Form 20-F \\nabout unresolved staff comments on its periodic and/or current \\nreports, or provide the disclosure required by Item 101(e)(4) of \\nRegulation S-K about whether it makes filings available on or \\nthrough its internet website. See 17 CFR 229.101(e)(4).\\n    \\\\26\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.13a-15(f) and 17 CFR 240.15d-15(f) (defining \\nICFR).\\n    \\\\27\\\\ See letter from Deloitte (suggesting that the Commission \\nexplain how an auditor's role in a financial statement audit will \\nchange as a result of the amendments).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    SOX Section 404(a) \\\\28\\\\ requires almost all issuers, including \\nSRCs, that file reports pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(a) or 15(d) \\n\\\\29\\\\ to establish and maintain ICFR and have their management assess \\nthe effectiveness of their ICFR.\\\\30\\\\ SOX Section 404(b) subjects \\ncertain issuers not otherwise exempted to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement.\\\\31\\\\ The most significant exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement is the exemption provided to EGCs pursuant to \\nTitle I of the JOBS Act (``JOBS Act Exemption''). Generally, an EGC is \\na company that has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 \\nbillion during its most recently completed fiscal year end and that has \\nnot sold common equity securities under a registration statement.\\\\32\\\\ \\nThe JOBS Act Exemption provides EGCs with a five-year exemption from \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement. We estimate that the JOBS Act \\nExemption applies to issuers with an aggregate market capitalization of \\nabout $585 billion, compared to about $95 billion in aggregate for the \\nissuers that are newly exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement under the amendments.\\\\33\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\28\\\\ 15 U.S.C. 7262(a).\\n    \\\\29\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 17 CFR 240.15d-15.\\n    \\\\30\\\\ Investment companies registered under Section 8 of the \\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C 80a-8, are specifically \\nexempted from SOX Section 404 by SOX Section 405, 15 U.S.C. 7263. \\nNotwithstanding the exemption pursuant to SOX Section 405, these \\nregistered investment companies are subject to other requirements \\nregarding internal controls. See Proposing Release, note 4 above, at \\n24879, n. 44.\\n    \\\\31\\\\ For example, SOX Section 404(c) exempts from Section 404(b) \\nany issuer that is neither a large accelerated filer nor an \\naccelerated filer. See 15 U.S.C. 7262(c).\\n    \\\\32\\\\ See 15 U.S.C. 77(b)(a)(19).\\n    \\\\33\\\\ These estimates are based on staff analysis of data on \\nmarket values from Compustat for annual reports in calendar year \\n2018. See note 298 below for details on the identification of the \\npopulation of different filer types. See note 336 below for details \\non the identification of the population of affected issuers. Out of \\nthe 1,430 issuers who qualified as EGCs in 2018, 1,097 are also non-\\naccelerated filers. The remaining EGCs are still exempt from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement solely due to the JOBS Act \\nExemption, and those issuers are significantly larger in terms of \\naggregate market capitalization (approximately $145 billion) than \\nthe issuers newly exempted under the amendments (approximately $95 \\nbillion). This estimate excludes 41 EGCs with an aggregate of \\napproximately $20 billion in market capitalization for which we are \\nunable to determine non-accelerated filer status, the majority of \\nwhich are Canadian issuers filing on Form 40-F.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2.

Comments on Using Revenue for Determining Accelerated and Large \\nAccelerated Filer Status\\n    A number of commenters stated explicitly that they supported using \\nrevenue as a measure to determine whether an issuer should be subject \\nto the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\36\\\\ These commenters \\nsuggested that using a revenue measurement is preferable to using a \\npublic float measurement \\\\37\\\\ because public float is often affected by \\nindustry or economic trends not specific to any particular issuer,\\\\38\\\\ \\nand that revenue is more predictable,\\\\39\\\\ a better indicator of an \\nissuer's complexity,\\\\40\\\\ and a better indicator of an issuer's ability \\nto absorb the burdens of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\41\\\\ \\nOther commenters questioned whether revenue is an appropriate measure \\nfor determining whether an issuer should be a non-accelerated filer in \\nall cases.\\\\42\\\\ One commenter asserted that low-revenue companies may \\nhave less sophisticated or experienced accounting functions and some \\naspects of their business may be associated with accounting \\ncomplexities.\\\\43\\\\ This commenter also suggested that issuers may \\nrecognize revenue in ways that could result in them frequently \\ntransitioning in and out of non-accelerated filer status.\\\\44\\\\ Another \\ncommenter indicated that an issuer could have a relatively low amount \\nof revenue but still have a large market capitalization and thus \\n``greater investor exposure.'' \\\\45\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\36\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BIO, Broadmark, Chamber, Concert, \\nCorvus, and MSB.\\n    \\\\37\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Broadmark, Chamber, Concert, \\nCorvus, and MSB.\\n    \\\\38\\\\ See letter from MSB.\\n    \\\\39\\\\ See letter from Broadmark.\\n    \\\\40\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Concert and Corvus.\\n    \\\\41\\\\ See letter from Broadmark.\\n    \\\\42\\\\ See letter from Ernst & Young LLP (July 29, 2019) (``EY''), \\nGrant Thornton, and National Association of State Boards of \\nAccountancy (July 23, 2019) (``NASBA'').\\n    \\\\43\\\\ See letter from EY.\\n    \\\\44\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\45\\\\ See letter from Grant Thornton.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Comments on the Proposed Amendments' Effect on Capital Formation and \\nthe Number of Public Issuers\\n    Commenters expressed mixed views on the effect that the proposed \\namendments would have on capital formation, the cost of capital, and \\nthe decisions of companies as to whether to enter the public capital \\nmarkets. Some commenters agreed with the view expressed in the \\nProposing Release that, by expanding the JOBS Act Exemption, the \\nproposed amendments would enhance capital formation or allow affected \\nissuers to preserve capital \\\\46\\\\ while also maintaining investor\\n\\n[[Page 17182]]\\n\\nprotection.\\\\47\\\\ One commenter, questioning the benefits, if any, of the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement, asserted that there is no \\ncorrelation between a smaller issuer's compliance with the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement and stronger markets in general.\\\\48\\\\ \\nAdditionally, some commenters suggested that eliminating the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement would encourage certain companies to \\nenter the public markets.\\\\49\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\46\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Andersen, CLSA, Concert, ICBA, and \\nNASBA.\\n    \\\\47\\\\ See, e.g., letters from ICBA and NASBA.\\n    \\\\48\\\\ See letter from BIO.\\n    \\\\49\\\\ See, e.g., letters from AdvaMed, AdvaMed et al., Broadmark, \\nCerecor, and ICBA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Conversely, other commenters asserted that the proposed amendments \\nwould not enhance capital formation, and some indicated they could even \\nreduce capital formation.\\\\50\\\\ Two of these commenters expressed the \\nview that eliminating the ICFR auditor attestation requirement could \\nincrease the cost of capital for certain issuers because investors \\nwould require a premium to invest in issuers due to the heightened risk \\nof ineffective internal controls.\\\\51\\\\ In addition, some commenters \\nmaintained that the ICFR auditor attestation requirement does not \\nprevent companies from entering the public markets.\\\\52\\\\ For example, \\none commenter suggested that the Proposing Release's statement about \\nthe significant decline in the number of issuers listed on major \\nexchanges implied that the cost of compliance with the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement has contributed materially to that decline.\\\\53\\\\ \\nThis commenter and some others asserted that the decline can be \\nattributed to many other factors.\\\\54\\\\ Some commenters stated that \\nconfidence in the U.S. capital market system, likely stems, at least in \\npart, from financial reporting safeguards, including the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement, and contended that the proposed amendments \\nwould thereby reduce investor confidence in issuers' financial \\nreporting.\\\\55\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\50\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CII, CFA, CFA \\nInst., and Prof. Ge et al.\\n    \\\\51\\\\ See letters from Better Markets and CFA.\\n    \\\\52\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., CII, and Crowe.\\n    \\\\53\\\\ See letter from CFA.\\n    \\\\54\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CII, CFA, CFA Inst., and Crowe. \\nOther factors commenters cited include the expansion of exemptions \\nto registration that increase companies' ability to raise funds \\nprivately, see, e.g., letters from CFA, CII, and Crowe; corporate \\nconsolidations, see, e.g., letters from CFA and CII; market \\nconditions, see letter from CFA; and the general regulatory \\nenvironment, see letter from Crowe.\\n    \\\\55\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ and CII.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters indicated that the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement is not necessary because issuers are permitted to \\nvoluntarily obtain an ICFR auditor attestation if they believe it is in \\ntheir interest to do so.\\\\56\\\\ Some instances in which commenters \\nsuggested that issuers may choose to voluntarily obtain an ICFR auditor \\nattestation include when their investors demand it,\\\\57\\\\ when not \\nobtaining it would have a negative impact on investment analysts' \\ncoverage,\\\\58\\\\ or when issuers otherwise deem it a good use of their \\ncapital resources.\\\\59\\\\ In this regard, one commenter suggested \\nclarifying that it is the authority and responsibility of the issuer's \\naudit committee to determine whether the issuer should voluntarily \\nobtain an ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\60\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\56\\\\ See, e.g., letters from ASA, BIO, Broadmark, Chamber, \\nGuaranty, and Nasdaq.\\n    \\\\57\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BIO and Guaranty.\\n    \\\\58\\\\ See letter from Guaranty.\\n    \\\\59\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\60\\\\ See letter from EY.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nc. Comments on the Proposed Amendments' Effect on Investor Protection\\n    Commenters' views as to the effect of the proposed amendments on \\ninvestor protection were also mixed. Many commenters asserted that, \\neven if the ICFR auditor attestation requirement did not apply, other \\nexisting requirements would provide investors in these issuers with \\nsufficient protection.\\\\61\\\\ Commenters cited a number of these other \\nrequirements, including SOX Section 404(a); \\\\62\\\\ Nasdaq's listing \\nstandards, surveillance, and enforcement; \\\\63\\\\ the required management \\ncertifications; \\\\64\\\\ and the obligation of an independent auditor to \\nconsider ICFR when conducting a financial statement audit.\\\\65\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\61\\\\ See, e.g., letters from ASA, Broadmark, BSC, Carver, \\nCerecor, Guaranty, ICBA, MSB, NAM, Nasdaq, Pieris, SCBA, and Xenon.\\n    \\\\62\\\\ See, e.g., letters from ASA, Broadmark, Carver, ICBA, MSB, \\nNasdaq, and Xenon.\\n    \\\\63\\\\ See letter from Nasdaq.\\n    \\\\64\\\\ See 17 CFR 229.601(31)(i), 17 CFR 240.13a-14(a), and 17 CFR \\n240.15d-14(a).

experience. \\nSee, e.g., letters from Adamas, Ardelyx, Catalyst, Chiasma, Corvus, \\nCymaBay, Equillium, Evoke, Gritstone, Kezar, Marinus, Millendo, \\nOrganovo, Pieris, Revance, SI-BONE, Syros,

commenters in the \\nbanking sector pointed out that community banks and bank holding \\ncompanies are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by \\nfederal and state banking regulators, which they stated would protect \\ninvestors in this industry even if the affected issuers were not \\nsubject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\73\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\73\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BSC, Guaranty, ICBA, and

investor protection and that \\neliminating it would undermine such protection.\\\\74\\\\\\n\\n[[Page 17183]]\\n\\nOne commenter disputed the contention in the Proposing Release that \\neliminating the ICFR auditor attestation requirement for low-revenue \\nissuers would not significantly affect the ability of investors to make \\ninformed investment decisions.\\\\75\\\\ Some commenters stated that the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement increases investor confidence generally \\n\\\\76\\\\ and that investors view the requirement as beneficial.\\\\77\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\74\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, Grant Thornton, and \\nProf. Barth et

low-revenue SRCs with sufficient \\nprotection if they were not also subject to the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement \\\\78\\\\ because, as one commenter stated, the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement acts as an effective check on SOX \\nSection 404(a).\\\\79\\\\ Another commenter asserted that management's \\nassessment is weakened when management knows that it will not be \\nchallenged by an ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\80\\\\ A third commenter \\nclaimed that investors would place undue reliance on management's \\nreport when not accompanied by an ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\81\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\78\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CFA Inst., Crowe, \\nGrant Thornton,

Thornton.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    A few commenters noted that a financial statement audit does not \\nprovide the same level of assurance as an integrated audit \\\\82\\\\ because \\na financial statement audit's objective is different from that of an \\nintegrated audit as it relates to ICFR.\\\\83\\\\ Therefore, some commenters \\nasserted that, without the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, the \\nrequirement for auditors to obtain an understanding of each component \\nof ICFR when conducting a financial statement audit would not provide \\nsufficient investor protection.\\\\84\\\\ Similarly, other commenters \\nsuggested that some testing of ICFR conducted as part of a financial \\nstatement audit would not provide sufficient investor protection.\\\\85\\\\ \\nOne commenter asserted that the control testing performed by a \\nfinancial statement auditor would not be as extensive as testing \\nperformed in an ICFR auditor attestation and that it is more difficult \\nfor a financial statement auditor to challenge the design of ICFR.\\\\86\\\\ \\nAnother commenter noted that, despite the requirement that a financial \\nstatement auditor communicate any significant deficiencies or material \\nweaknesses related to ICFR to the issuer's management and its audit \\ncommittee, a financial statement audit is not designed to identify such \\nsignificant deficiencies or material weaknesses.\\\\87\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\82\\\\ See, e.g.,

Other Comments\\n    We received a variety of other comments on the Proposing Release. \\nSome commenters noted that it is difficult for investors to easily \\ndetermine whether an issuer's filing includes an ICFR auditor \\nattestation.\\\\138\\\\ These commenters suggested requiring issuers to \\ndisclose whether they are exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement \\\\139\\\\ and/or have voluntarily obtained an ICFR auditor \\nattestation \\\\140\\\\ either on a filing's cover page,\\\\141\\\\ such as with a \\ncheck box,\\\\142\\\\ or in management's report on ICFR.\\\\143\\\\ Two commenters \\nrecommended that the Commission engage in a post-implementation review \\nof the impact of the final amendments,\\\\144\\\\ with one of these \\ncommenters recommending that\\n\\n[[Page 17185]]\\n\\nthe final amendments require a review of the impact of the changes on \\nthe affected registrants five years after adoption of the \\namendments.\\\\145\\\\ Some commenters requested that we allow sufficient \\ntime and notice for auditors and issuers to prepare for compliance with \\nthe final amendments,\\\\146\\\\ whereas other commenters noted that some \\nissuers may be subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement for \\nonly a short time \\\\147\\\\ and requested the Commission adopt final \\namendments quickly.\\\\148\\\\ One commenter asserted that the measurement \\ndate for non-accelerated filer status and the timing of the start of \\nthe auditor's attestation of ICFR is burdensome to small biotech \\nregistrants.\\\\149\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\138\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ, CFA Inst., and Grant \\nThornton.\\n    \\\\139\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst., CII, and Grant \\nThornton.\\n    \\\\140\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst. and KPMG.\\n    \\\\141\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ, CFA Inst., CII, and Grant \\nThornton.\\n    \\\\142\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ and Grant Thornton.\\n    \\\\143\\\\ See letter from Grant Thornton.\\n    \\\\144\\\\ See letters from IMA and PWC.\\n    \\\\145\\\\ See letter from IMA.\\n    \\\\146\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BDO, CAQ, Crowe, EY, KPMG, PWC, \\nand RSM.\\n    \\\\147\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Concert, MSB, Nasdaq, and Xenon.\\n    \\\\148\\\\ See, e.g., letters from MSB and Summit.\\n    \\\\149\\\\ See letter from Corvus. Public float for both SRC status \\nand accelerated and large accelerated filer status is measured on \\nthe last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second \\nfiscal quarter, and revenue for purposes of determining SRC status \\nis measured based on annual revenues for the most recent fiscal year \\ncompleted before the last business day of the second fiscal quarter. \\nTherefore, an issuer will be aware of any change in SRC status or \\naccelerated or large accelerated filer status as of that date. \\nAlthough an issuer that determines it will no longer be eligible to \\nbe an SRC is permitted to continue to use the SRC accommodations for \\nthe Form 10-K for the year in which it fails the measurement test, \\nan issuer that becomes an accelerated or large accelerated filer on \\nthat same measurement date would be required to include the ICFR \\nauditor attestation in that Form 10-K. See Rule 12b-2, Item \\n10(f)(2)(i)(C), and Rule 405. Although the transition provisions \\napply differently, the measurement dates for SRC status and \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer status each provide an \\nissuer with at least six months to prepare for a change in its \\nstatus, and we continue to believe that this is an adequate amount \\nof time to prepare for the transition.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Additionally, although we did not propose amendments to the \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer definitions that would \\nspecifically address foreign private issuers (``FPI'') or business \\ndevelopment companies (``BDC''), we solicited comment on these points \\nand a few commenters requested we do so.\\\\150\\\\ One commenter asserted \\nthat there should be no disparity between an FPI that presents its \\nfinancial statements in accordance with International Financial \\nReporting Standards (``IFRS'') and a domestic issuer or FPI that \\npresents its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\\\\151\\\\ \\nThe commenter noted that an FPI that presents its financial statements \\nin accordance with IFRS cannot be an SRC, so such an FPI cannot rely on \\nthe proposed amendments. Another commenter recommended that the \\nCommission extend the benefits of non-accelerated filer status to BDCs \\nif they have total investment income of less than $80 million in their \\nmost recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial \\nstatements are available and have either no public float or public \\nfloat of less than $700 million.\\\\152\\\\ The commenter stated that \\nallowing BDCs to qualify as non-accelerated filers under this modified \\nSRC revenue test would reduce regulatory asymmetry between BDCs and \\noperating companies, consistent with recent congressional mandates to \\nallow BDCs to use the same offering rules as operating companies. The \\ncommenter also suggested that allowing smaller BDCs to benefit from \\nnon-accelerated filer status would ease regulatory costs and burdens, \\nwhich could encourage more BDCs to enter public markets, creating \\ngreater access to capital for small operating companies and expanding \\ninvestment opportunities for retail investors.\\\\153\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\150\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Dorsey & Whitney LLP (Aug. 16, \\n2019) (``Dorsey & Whitney'') and Proskauer Rose LLP (July 26, 2019) \\n(``Proskauer'').\\n    \\\\151\\\\ See letter from Dorsey & Whitney.\\n    \\\\152\\\\ See letter from Proskauer.\\n    \\\\153\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Final Amendments\\n    After considering the comments, we are adopting the final \\namendments substantially as proposed. The final amendments add a new \\ncondition to the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions in \\nRule 12b-2 that excludes an issuer that is eligible to be an SRC and \\nthat had annual revenues of less than $100 million in the most recent \\nfiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. The \\namendments also allow BDCs to qualify for this exclusion if they meet \\nthe requirements of the SRC revenue test using their annual investment \\nincome as the measure of annual revenue, although BDCs would continue \\nto be ineligible to be SRCs.\\\\154\\\\ The final amendments are consistent \\nwith our historical practice of providing scaled disclosure and other \\naccommodations for smaller issuers \\\\155\\\\ and with recent actions by \\nCongress to reduce burdens on new and smaller issuers.\\\\156\\\\ The table \\nbelow summarizes the conditions required to be considered an \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer under the final amendments to \\nRule 12b-2.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\154\\\\ See Section II.B.3.f. below.\\n    \\\\155\\\\ See, e.g., Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and \\nSimplification, Release No. 33-8876 (Dec. 19, 2007) [73 FR 934 (Jan. \\n4, 2008)]; Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and \\nSimplification, Release No. 33-8876 (Dec. 19, 2007) [73 FR 934 (Jan. \\n4, 2008)] (``2007 SRC Adopting Release''); and SRC Adopting Release, \\nnote 12 above.\\n    \\\\156\\\\ See note 11 above.\\n\\n Table 1--Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Conditions Under\\n                          the Final Amendments\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                               Final large accelerated\\n     Final accelerated filer conditions            filer conditions\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe issuer has a public float of $75         The issuer has a public\\n million or more, but less than $700          float of $700 million or\\n million, as of the last business day of      more, as of the last\\n the issuer's most recently completed         business day of the\\n second fiscal quarter.                       issuer's most recently\\n                                              completed second fiscal\\n                                              quarter.\\nThe issuer has been subject to the           Same.\\n requirements of Exchange Act Section 13(a)\\n or 15(d) for a period of at least twelve\\n calendar months.\\nThe issuer has filed at least one annual     Same.\\n report pursuant Exchange Act Section 13(a)\\n or 15(d).\\nThe issuer is not eligible to use the        Same.\\n requirements for SRCs under the revenue\\n test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(B), as\\n applicable, of the ``smaller reporting\\n company'' definition in Rule 12b-2 or, in\\n the case of a BDC, does not meet the\\n requirements of the revenue test in those\\n paragraphs using annual investment income\\n as the measure of its annual revenues.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Below we discuss specific aspects of the final amendments about \\nwhich we received significant public comment and our response to those \\ncomments. In many cases, our responses reflect analysis and data that \\nis more comprehensively presented in the Economic Analysis.\\\\157\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\157\\\\ See Section IV. below.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 17186]]\\n\\na. Using Revenue for Determining Accelerated and Large Accelerated \\nFiler Status\\n    As discussed above,\\\\158\\\\ several commenters supported the use of \\nrevenue in the proposal, providing a variety of reasons that a revenue \\nmeasurement is preferable to using a public float measurement.\\\\159\\\\ \\nOthers, however, questioned whether revenue is an appropriate measure \\nfor determining whether an issuer should be considered a non-\\naccelerated filer.\\\\160\\\\ One of these commenters asserted that low-\\nrevenue issuers may have less sophisticated or experienced accounting \\nfunctions and some aspects of their business may be associated with \\naccounting complexities.\\\\161\\\\ Also, the commenter suggested that these \\nissuers may recognize revenue in ways that could result in them \\nfrequently transitioning in and out of non-accelerated filer \\nstatus.\\\\162\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\158\\\\ See Section II.A.2.a. above.\\n    \\\\159\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Broadmark, Chamber, Concert, \\nCorvus, and MSB.\\n    \\\\160\\\\ See, e.g., letters from EY and Grant Thornton, and NASBA.\\n    \\\\161\\\\ See letter from EY.\\n    \\\\162\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As we discuss in more detail below,\\\\163\\\\ we continue to believe, as \\na general matter, that there may be greater costs and relatively lower \\nbenefits to including low-revenue issuers, as compared to other \\nissuers, in the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions. \\nWhile we recognize that the circumstances of individual issuers and \\ntheir accounting systems and processes may vary, we believe that low-\\nrevenue issuers may, on average, be less susceptible to the risk of \\ncertain types of restatements, such as those related to revenue \\nrecognition.\\\\164\\\\ We also note that the revisions to the transition \\nthresholds included in the final amendments may help minimize the risk \\nof frequent reclassifications of issuer status.\\\\165\\\\ For these reasons, \\nwe continue to believe that revenue is an appropriate measure for \\ndetermining whether an issuer should be considered a non-accelerated \\nfiler.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\163\\\\ See Sections II.B.3.d. and Section IV.C.2.d. below.\\n    \\\\164\\\\ See Section IV.C.3. below.\\n    \\\\165\\\\ See Section II.C. below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nb. Effect on Capital Formation and the Number of Public Companies\\n    Under the final amendments, an issuer that is eligible to be an SRC \\nand that meets the SRC revenue test will not be required to comply with \\naccelerated or large accelerated filer requirements and, thereby, will \\nnot be subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. Not \\nsubjecting these affected issuers to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement should reduce their compliance costs. As discussed in the \\nEconomic Analysis,\\\\166\\\\ we estimate that, consistent with the proposal, \\nan issuer no longer subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nwould save approximately $210,000 per year comprised of approximately \\n$110,000 per year reduction in audit fees and an additional reduction \\nin non-audit costs of approximately $100,000.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\166\\\\ See Section IV.C.2.b. below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Some commenters stated that eliminating the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement would enhance capital formation or allow those \\nissuers to preserve capital.\\\\167\\\\ We note, however, that a number of \\nother commenters asserted that these cost savings would be small,\\\\168\\\\ \\nand may not help capital formation.\\\\169\\\\ As we discuss in the Economic \\nAnalysis,\\\\170\\\\ we continue to believe that the expected savings are \\nlikely to represent a meaningful cost savings for many of the affected \\nissuers and, therefore, may have a positive effect on capital \\npreservation and formation. Although the average annual cost savings \\nmay represent a small percentage of the average affected issuer's \\nrevenues and market capitalization, we believe those savings may be \\nmeaningful given that affected issuers have, on average, negative net \\nincome and negative net cash flows from operations.\\\\171\\\\ More \\ngenerally, low-revenue issuers are likely to face financing constraints \\nbecause they do not have access to internally generated capital.\\\\172\\\\ \\nTherefore, the average savings of $210,000 per year for these issuers \\nmay be put to productive use \\\\173\\\\ such as developing the company.\\\\174\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\167\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Andersen, CLSA, Concert, ICBA, and \\nNASBA.\\n    \\\\168\\\\ See letters from CFA, CFA Inst., CII, and Prof. Barth et \\nal.\\n    \\\\169\\\\ See note 50 above.\\n    \\\\170\\\\ See Section IV.C.2.d. below.\\n    \\\\171\\\\ See note 362 below.\\n    \\\\172\\\\ This information is based on staff analysis of data from \\nCompustat. See Section IV.C.2.d. below.\\n    \\\\173\\\\ For example, in a survey of issuers in the biotech \\nindustry, among 11 biotech EGCs that responded to a question \\nregarding how an extension of the exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement would affect them given the costs associated \\nwith the requirement, eight out of the 11 issuers indicated that \\nthey expected a positive impact on investments in research and \\ndevelopment and six out of the 11 issuers indicated that they \\nexpected a positive impact on hiring employees.

Over the past two decades, \\nthe number of issuers listed on major exchanges has decreased by about \\n40 percent,\\\\176\\\\ but the decline has been concentrated among smaller \\nsize issuers. For example, the number of listed issuers with a market \\ncapitalization below $700 million has decreased by about 65 \\npercent,\\\\177\\\\ and the number of issuers with less than $100 million in \\nrevenue has decreased by about 60 percent.\\\\178\\\\ Although factors other \\nthan the ICFR auditor attestation requirement may have contributed to \\nthe decline,\\\\179\\\\ we believe that the described cost reductions \\nassociated with the final amendments could be a positive factor in \\nencouraging additional small companies to register their securities \\nofferings or a class of their securities, which would provide an \\nincreased level of transparency and investor protection with respect to \\nthose companies.\\\\180\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\175\\\\ See Section III.C.1. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.

Effect on Investor Protection\\n    We continue to believe that the amendments are not likely to have a \\nsignificant effect on the overall ability of investors in the affected \\nissuers to make informed investment decisions and note that many \\ncommenters agreed with this assessment.\\\\181\\\\ As discussed in greater \\ndetail in the Proposing Release,\\\\182\\\\ issuers have a number of other \\nobligations that we believe will provide sufficient protections for \\ninvestors in the affected issuers and allow investors in those issuers \\nto make informed investment decisions. These responsibilities derive \\nfrom the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (``FCPA'')\\n\\n[[Page 17187]]\\n\\nrequirements with respect to internal accounting controls \\\\183\\\\ as well \\nas a number of different changes to financial reporting that were \\nintroduced by SOX.\\\\184\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\181\\\\ See note 61 to 68 above and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\182\\\\ See Section II.B. of the Proposing Release, note 4 above.\\n    \\\\183\\\\ The FCPA added Section 13(b)(2)(B) to the Exchange Act, 15 \\nU.S.C 78m(b)(2)(B) (referring to ``internal accounting controls'' \\nrather than ICFR).\\n    \\\\184\\\\ See, e.g., SOX Sections 302, 15 U.S.C. 7241, and 404(a) \\nand related rules.

In addition, affected issuers are \\nrequired to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting \\ncontrols sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions \\nare recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial \\nstatements in conformity with GAAP.\\\\185\\\\ Also, the principal executive \\nand financial officers of certain issuers are required to certify that, \\namong other things, they are responsible for establishing and \\nmaintaining ICFR, have designed disclosure controls and procedures to \\nensure material information relating to the issuer and its consolidated \\nsubsidiaries is made known to such officers by others within those \\nentities, and have evaluated and reported on the effectiveness of the \\nissuer's disclosure controls and procedures.\\\\186\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\185\\\\ 15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(2)(B).\\n    \\\\186\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.13a-14 or 17 CFR 240.15d-14 (requiring \\ncertification) and 17 CFR 229.601(b)(31) (prescribing certification \\ncontent). These rules were adopted pursuant to SOX Section 302. See \\n15 U.S.C. 7241.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Furthermore, the issuers that are subject to the final amendments \\nwill remain subject to a financial statement audit by an independent \\nauditor, which will help maintain appropriate investor protections. \\nEven without an ICFR auditor attestation requirement, an independent \\nauditor is required to consider ICFR in the performance of a financial \\nstatement audit.\\\\187\\\\ We acknowledge, as stated by some \\ncommenters,\\\\188\\\\ that the objective of a financial statement audit and \\nthe level of control testing performed is different from an ICFR audit. \\nHowever, we believe that the requirements of a financial statement \\naudit, among other requirements, provide some additional protections \\nand that, for low-revenue SRCs, this and the other protections and \\nfactors associated with these issuers described above sufficiently \\nmitigate the risk that the final amendments will adversely affect the \\nability of investors to make informed investment decisions.\\\\189\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\187\\\\ See Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (``PCAOB'') \\nAccounting Standard (``AS'') 2110, Identifying and Assessing Risks \\nof Material Misstatement, paragraphs .18 through .40 (``PCAOB AS \\n2110''), paragraphs .18 through .40.\\n    \\\\188\\\\ See note 83 above.\\n    \\\\189\\\\ See Section IV.C.3.b. below (stating that, in the \\nProposing Release, note 4 above, we noted that low-revenue issuers \\nmay be less likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose \\nmaterial weaknesses in the absence of an ICFR auditor attestation, \\nperhaps because they have less complex financial systems and \\ncontrols).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For example, the auditor in a financial statement audit is required \\nto identify and assess the risks of material misstatements, which is \\nsimilar to the risk assessment evaluation required in an ICFR auditor \\nattestation. Additionally, the auditor engaged in a financial statement \\naudit often may test the operating effectiveness of certain internal \\ncontrols even if not performing an integrated audit to reduce the \\nextent of substantive testing required to issue an opinion on the \\nfinancial statements. Moreover, even if an auditor decides not to rely \\non internal controls to reduce the extent of substantive testing, the \\nauditor may still identify internal control deficiencies during such \\nsubstantive testing in a financial statement audit.\\n    Under PCAOB standards, the evaluation and communication of \\nsignificant deficiencies and material weaknesses in ICFR to management \\nand the issuer's audit committee is required in both a financial \\nstatement audit and an ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\190\\\\ The evaluation of \\nthe severity of a control deficiency identified by the auditor is the \\nsame for a financial statement audit and an ICFR auditor attestation. \\nFurther, a financial statement auditor has the responsibility to review \\nmanagement's disclosure for any misstatement of facts, such as a \\nstatement that ICFR is effective when there is a known material \\nweakness.\\\\191\\\\ Therefore, we continue to believe significant \\ndeficiencies and material weaknesses that an ICFR auditor attestation \\nmay uncover also may be uncovered as a part of the financial statement \\naudit of a low-revenue SRC. As discussed above,\\\\192\\\\ because of these \\nrequirements, a number of commenters agreed that an auditor of the \\nfinancial statements of a low-revenue issuer that would be exempt from \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement under the final amendments \\nwould still be required to consider ICFR and therefore this process \\nwould provide sufficient investor protection.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\190\\\\ See Section II.C. of the Proposing Release, note 4 above.\\n    \\\\191\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\192\\\\ See notes 61 to 68 above and accompanying text.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Other developments may serve to reinforce these existing investor \\nprotections. In 2010, the PCAOB adopted enhanced auditing standards \\nrelated to the auditor's assessment of, and response to, risk that, in \\npart, clarify and augment the extent to which internal controls are to \\nbe considered in a financial statement audit.\\\\193\\\\ In particular, these \\nrisk assessment standards require auditors in both an integrated and \\nfinancial statement audit to evaluate the design of certain \\ncontrols.\\\\194\\\\ The PCAOB has expressed concern about the number and \\nsignificance of deficiencies in auditing firm compliance with these \\nrisk assessment auditing standards, but it has also noted promising \\nimprovements in their application.\\\\195\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\193\\\\ See Auditing Standards Related to the Auditor's Assessment \\nof and Response to Risk and Related Amendments to PCAOB Standards, \\nPCAOB Release No. 2010-004 (Aug. 5, 2010) (``PCAOB Release No. 2010-\\n004'').

In Section IV.C.3.b.5, we note, as an \\nexample, that issuers may have made investments in systems, procedures, \\nor training to explain how control improvements may persist for certain \\naffected issuers. Finally, we note that auditors have had many years of \\nexperience with the 2010 risk assessment standards, and therefore \\nauditors may be more likely to test ICFR, even if an ICFR auditor \\nattestation is not required, as a means of enhancing auditing \\nefficiency.\\\\198\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\196\\\\ See SEC Charges Four Public Companies with Longstanding \\nICFR Failures, press release (Jan. 29,2019) (``SEC Press Release''), \\navailable at \\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-6\\n.\\n    \\\\197\\\\ See, e.g., Kevin Moffitt, Andrea Rozario, & Miklos \\nVasarhelyi (2018), Robotic Process Automation for Auditing, Journal \\nof Emerging Technologies, 15(1) Acct. 1 (``Robotic Process \\nAutomation'') (describing how, for example, a robotic process \\nautomation program can be ``set up to automatically match purchase \\norders, invoices, and shipping documents [and] can check that the \\nprice and quantity on each of the documents match [to] help auditors \\nvalidate the effectiveness of preventive internal controls . . . \\n.'').\\n    \\\\198\\\\ See Study and Recommendations on Section 404(b) of the \\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 For Issuers With Public Float Between $75 \\nand $250 Million at 106 (Apr. 2011) (``2011 SEC Staff Study''), \\navailable at \\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/404bfloat-study.pdf\\n (stating that ``. . . once effective controls are in place \\nat the issuer, the auditor is more likely to continue to test them \\neven if [it is] not issuing an auditor attestation during a \\nparticular year in order to rely on them for purposes of reducing \\nsubstantive testing in the audit of the financial statements, \\nparticularly for issuers that are larger and more complex'').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We recognize that some commenters disagreed with this assessment \\nand asserted that investor protections other than the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement would not be sufficient because, among other \\nreasons, a financial statement audit has a different objective than an \\nintegrated audit,\\\\199\\\\ testing of ICFR in a financial statement audit \\nis not as extensive,\\\\200\\\\ it is more difficult for a financial \\nstatement auditor to challenge the design of ICFR,\\\\201\\\\ and a financial \\nstatement audit is not designed to identify significant ICFR \\ndeficiencies or material weaknesses.\\\\202\\\\ As discussed in the Economic \\nAnalysis, we acknowledge that the amendments may be associated with \\nsome adverse effects on the effectiveness of ICFR and the reliability \\nof financial statements for the affected issuers.\\\\203\\\\ However, the \\nProposing Release presented evidence that suggests that these effects \\nand their impact on investor protection are likely to be mitigated in \\nthe case of the affected issuers as compared to other accelerated \\nfilers.

We \\nnote, however, that relative to higher-revenue issuers, on average, \\nrisk among these issuers is likely more associated with their future \\nprospects than their current financial statements.\\\\207\\\\ Therefore, \\nexempting low-revenue issuers from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement is less likely to affect investor protections with respect \\nto those issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\205\\\\ See letter from Grant Thornton.\\n    \\\\206\\\\ See Section IV.C.3.d. below.\\n    \\\\207\\\\ Also, the affected parties are limited to issuers with no \\nmore than $700 million in public float.

Disproportionate Costs and Benefits of the ICFR Auditor Attestation \\nfor Small and Low-Revenue Companies\\n    Not only is the ICFR auditor attestation requirement costly in \\ngeneral, as discussed above, a number of commenters asserted that the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement is disproportionally costly to \\nsmall and low-revenue issuers.\\\\212\\\\ We agree that the costs of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement may be particularly burdensome for \\nthese issuers because they include fixed costs that are not scalable \\nfor smaller issuers, as also noted by several commenters.\\\\213\\\\ Further, \\nlow-revenue issuers have limited access to internally generated \\ncapital, and so the costs may more directly impact their ability to \\nspend on investments or hiring.\\\\214\\\\ We therefore expect that reducing \\nthese costs would have a more beneficial impact on small and low-\\nrevenue issuers than it would for other issuers. Some commenters \\nsimilarly expressed the view that the amendments would enhance these \\nissuers' ability to preserve capital without significantly affecting \\nthe ability of investors to make informed investment decisions based on \\nthe financial reporting of those issuers.\\\\215\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\212\\\\ See note 102 above and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\213\\\\ See letters from ASA, Broadmark, Chamber, and Guaranty.\\n    \\\\214\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Dar[eacute], Summit and Xenon.\\n    \\\\215\\\\ See letters from Andersen, CLSA, Concert, ICBA, and NASBA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As discussed above, other commenters claimed that eliminating the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement would not substantially reduce \\ncosts to issuers \\\\216\\\\ and that there would be other negative impacts \\nof this change.\\\\217\\\\ We acknowledge that the magnitude of these cost \\nsavings likely will vary among issuers depending upon their\\n\\n[[Page 17189]]\\n\\nparticular facts and circumstances \\\\218\\\\ and, as some commenters \\nasserted,\\\\219\\\\ ICFR auditor attestations have become less expensive \\nover time because auditors are more experienced in conducting them. \\nHowever, based on the comments received and our own analysis of \\navailable data,\\\\220\\\\ we believe the cost reductions from not being \\nsubject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement could be \\nsubstantial for affected issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\216\\\\ See note 108 above and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\217\\\\ See notes 110 to 113 above and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\218\\\\ See, e.g., letters from EY, Grant Thornton, and PWC.\\n    \\\\219\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst. and Deloitte.\\n    \\\\220\\\\ See Section IV.C.2.d.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We believe the benefits of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nlikely are fewer for low-revenue SRCs than for other issuers, an \\nassessment supported by some commenters.\\\\221\\\\ As a result, obtaining \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation is likely, on average, to be less \\nmeaningful for these issuers, and not obtaining one should have less of \\nan impact on investor protection than for other types of issuers. \\nFirst, we note that low-revenue SRCs may be less susceptible to the \\nrisk of certain kinds of misstatements, such as those related to \\nrevenue recognition. As discuss in the Economic Analysis,\\\\222\\\\ 10 to 20 \\npercent of restatements and about 60 percent of financial disclosure \\nfraud cases in recent times have been associated with improper revenue \\nrecognition,\\\\223\\\\ which is less of a risk, for example, for issuers \\nthat currently have little to no revenue.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\221\\\\ See notes 116 to 118 above and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\222\\\\ See Section IV.C.3. below.\\n    \\\\223\\\\ See Audit Analytics, 2017 Financial Restatements: A \\nSeventeen Year Comparison, (May 2018), and Committee of Sponsoring \\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission, (``COSO''), Fraudulent \\nFinancial Reporting 1998-2007: An Analysis of U.S. Public Companies \\n(2010).) (``COSO 2010 Fraud Study''), available at \\nhttp://www.coso.org/documents/COSO-Fraud-Study-2010-001.pdf\\n.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Second, as we noted in Table 14 of the Proposing Release,\\\\224\\\\ \\nissuers with revenues of less than $100 million have, on average, \\nrestatement rates that are three to nine percentage points lower than \\nthose for higher-revenue issuers. Moreover, certain low-revenue SRCs \\nlikely have less complex financial systems and controls and, therefore, \\nmay be less likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose \\nmaterial weaknesses in the absence of an ICFR auditor attestation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\224\\\\ See Section III.C.4.b. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Third, we believe that those issuers' financial statements may be \\nless critical to assessing their valuation given, for example, the \\nrelative importance of their future prospects. We recognize that other \\ncommenters disagreed and asserted that benefits of the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement are greater for lower-revenue and smaller \\nissuers than for other issuers.\\\\225\\\\ We carefully considered these \\ncomments and, as discussed in the Economic Analysis, investigated the \\nclaims by conducting supplemental analysis, but we did not find \\nevidence that led us to alter our views.\\\\226\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\225\\\\ See notes 119 to 124 above and accompanying text.\\n    \\\\226\\\\ See Section IV.C.3.a. below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ne. Relationship Between Non-Accelerated Filers and SRCs\\n    Under the final amendments, some, but not all, SRCs would become \\nnon-accelerated filers. We are not adopting an alternative suggested by \\nsome commenters of fully aligning the SRC and non-accelerated filer \\ndefinitions. As we note in the Economic Analysis,\\\\227\\\\ although full \\nalignment of the two definitions could provide several benefits, \\nincluding greater regulatory simplicity, reducing any frictions or \\nconfusion associated with issuers' determination of their filer status \\nor reporting regime, and expanding the number of issuers that qualify \\nas non-accelerated filers, fully aligning the two definitions also \\ncould result in costs that are greater than those for the amendments we \\nare adopting. For example, the mitigating factors associated with \\nexempting low-revenue issuers, such as a potential lower susceptibility \\nto the risks of certain kinds of misstatements and a greater role of \\nfuture prospects relative to current financial statements in driving \\nmarket valuations for these issuers as compared to other issuers,\\\\228\\\\ \\nmay not be present or may be more limited, for other types of SRCs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\227\\\\ See Section IV.C.5.a. below.\\n    \\\\228\\\\ See Section IV.C.3. below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As a result, fully aligning the SRC and non-accelerated filer \\nthresholds could have adverse effects on the reliability of the \\nfinancial statements of the issuers with higher revenues and the \\nability of investors to make informed investment decisions about those \\nissuers.\\\\229\\\\ Therefore, we do not believe it would be appropriate at \\nthis time to increase the public float threshold for non-accelerated \\nfilers to align that definition with the SRC definition. Additionally, \\nwe note that many non-accelerated filers remain eligible for the JOBS \\nAct Exemption for their first five years as a public company. The table \\nbelow summarizes the relationships between SRCs and non-accelerated and \\naccelerated filers under the final amendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\229\\\\ Id.\\n\\n  Table 2--Relationships Between SRCs and Non-Accelerated, Accelerated, and Large Accelerated Filers Under the\\n                                                Final Amendments\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Relationships between SRCs and non-accelerated, accelerated, and large accelerated filers under the final\\n                                                   amendments\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                Status                         Public float                       Annual revenues\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSRC and Non-Accelerated Filer.........

N/A.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nf. Effect on Business Development Companies\\n    In a change from the proposal, the final amendments also exclude \\nBDCs from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions under \\ncircumstances that are analogous to the exclusions for other issuers \\nunder the amendments. The amendments include a specific provision \\napplicable to BDCs, because BDCs are not eligible to be SRCs and to \\nprovide a definition of ``revenue'' for BDCs to use for this \\npurpose.\\\\230\\\\ Specifically, a BDC will be excluded from the accelerated \\nand large\\n\\n[[Page 17190]]\\n\\naccelerated filer definitions in Rule 12b-2 if the BDC: (1) Has a \\npublic float of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million; and \\n(2) has investment income of less than $100 million.\\\\231\\\\ The \\namendments to Rule 12b-2 provide that, for this purpose, a BDC's \\nrevenue is the BDC's investment income, as defined in Rule 6-07.1 of \\nRegulation S-X.\\\\232\\\\ BDCs are subject to the same transition provisions \\nfor accelerated filer and large accelerated status that apply to other \\nissuers under the amendments, except that the amendments' BDC-specific \\n``revenue'' definition will apply to these transition provisions as \\nwell.\\\\233\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\230\\\\ Although a BDC is considered to be eligible to use the \\nrequirements for SRCs under the revenue test in paragraph (2) or \\n(3)(iii)(B) of the ``smaller reporting company'' definition in Rule \\n12b-2 for purposes of the amended accelerated filer and large \\naccelerated filer definitions, BDCs will continue to be ineligible \\nto be SRCs under the final amendments.\\n    \\\\231\\\\ See paragraphs (1)(iv), (2)(iv), and (4) of the amended \\ndefinitions of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer in Rule \\n12b-2. Consistent with the current definitions of these terms, a BDC \\nwith public float of less than $75 million is already a non-\\naccelerated filer, regardless of the amount of its annual investment \\nincome.\\n    \\\\232\\\\ See 17 CFR 210.6-07.1.\\n    \\\\233\\\\ See Section II.C. below (discussing the amended transition \\nprovisions more generally).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Although the Commission did not propose to exclude BDCs from the \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer definitions using the SRC \\nrevenue test, the Commission did solicit comment on such an approach \\nand discussed the relative costs and benefits of this alternative in \\nthe Proposing Release.\\\\234\\\\ In response, one commenter urged that we \\nadopt such an approach, stating that, among other reasons, the policy \\nreasons that support providing regulatory relief to smaller reporting \\ncompanies should apply equally to smaller BDCs.\\\\235\\\\ This commenter \\nsuggested that the Commission expand the proposed amendment to the \\ndefinition of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer to exclude \\nBDCs with total investment income of less than $80 million in the most \\nrecently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements \\nare available and either no public float or public float of less than \\n$700 million.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\234\\\\ See Sections II.C., II.E., and III.C.6. of the Proposing \\nRelease, note 4 above.\\n    \\\\235\\\\ See letter from Proskauer.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Although we observed in the Proposing Release that the SRC revenue \\ntest would not be meaningful for BDCs because BDCs prepare financial \\nstatements under Article 6 of Regulation S-X and generally do not \\nreport revenue, the final amendments' definition of ``revenue'' for \\npurposes of the BDC-specific provisions incorporate information that \\nBDCs report in their financial statements. A BDC's investment income \\nincludes income from dividends, interest on securities, and other \\nincome.\\\\236\\\\ We recognize, as stated in the Proposing Release, that \\ninvestors in BDCs generally may place greater significance on the \\nfinancial reporting of BDCs relative to low-revenue non-investment \\ncompany issuers and BDC financial statements will continue to be \\naudited by an independent auditor. As the commenter supporting this \\napproach observed, however, the policy considerations supporting the \\nfinal amendments generally apply to BDCs.\\\\237\\\\ Moreover, BDCs that are \\nexcluded from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions \\nwill remain obligated, among other things, to establish and maintain \\ninternal control over financial reporting and have management assess \\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

Effect on Foreign Private Issuers\\n    Under the proposed amendments, an FPI would be excluded from the \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer definitions if it qualifies as \\nan SRC \\\\239\\\\ under the SRC revenue test in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. One \\ncommenter asserted that the final amendments should permit an FPI that \\npresents its financial statements using IFRS to qualify for the \\nexemption based on the low-revenue test.\\\\240\\\\ We note that foreign \\nissuers that qualify as FPIs or SRCs are permitted to avail themselves \\nof special accommodations unique to each reporting regime, but must \\nselect one reporting regime or the other. The final amendments provide \\nan exemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement for low-\\nrevenue SRCs. Issuers that qualify as FPIs and elect to use the FPI \\nreporting regime have other accommodations available to them, such as \\nthe ability to disclose material changes in their ICFR and \\neffectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures on an annual basis, \\nas compared to the quarterly basis required of U.S. issuers, including \\nSRCs.\\\\241\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\239\\\\ See 2007 SRC Adopting Release, note 155 above, Section II, \\nand Acceptance From Foreign Private Issuers of Financial Statements \\nPrepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards without Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, Release No. 33-8879 \\n(Dec. 21, 2007) [73 FR 985 (Jan. 4, 2008)], Section III.E.4. \\n(stating that an FPI is not an SRC unless it makes its filings on \\nforms available to U.S. domestic issuers and otherwise qualifies to \\nuse the SRC scaled disclosure accommodations).

Requiring ICFR Auditor Attestation Less Frequently Than Annually\\n    The final amendments do not revise our rules to require an ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement less frequently than annually. Issuers \\nthat are accelerated or large accelerated filers will be required to \\nobtain an ICFR auditor attestation every year, unless they qualify as \\nEGCs, as under our current rules. We did not propose to revise this \\nrequirement, but requested comment on this matter, and every commenter \\nthat discussed the subject \\\\242\\\\ asserted that issuers that are subject \\nto the ICFR auditor attestation requirement should obtain one annually. \\nA few of these commenters asserted that requiring the ICFR auditor \\nattestation only once every three years would not decrease costs \\nsignificantly because auditors consider prior year audit results when \\nplanning and performing the current year audit, so performing an audit \\nof ICFR every three years would reduce efficiencies gained from \\nperforming audits annually and add complexity and costs.\\\\243\\\\ Also, one \\ncommenter indicated that auditors in many instances may continue to \\ntest internal controls in the financial statement audit, which \\npotentially limits any resulting cost reduction.\\\\244\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\242\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Crowe, KPMG, and NASBA.\\n    \\\\243\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Crowe and KPMG.\\n    \\\\244\\\\ See letter from KPMG.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ni. Check Box Indicating Whether an ICFR Auditor Attestation Is Included \\nin a Filing\\n    Although we did not propose a requirement that issuers report \\nwhether they have obtained an ICFR auditor attestation, we requested \\ncomment on whether we should do so. As discussed above,\\\\245\\\\ some \\ncommenters recommended that the final rule include a requirement for an \\nissuer to prominently disclose in its filing whether an ICFR auditor \\nattestation is included. This type of disclosure was also recommended \\nby the Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') in a\\n\\n[[Page 17191]]\\n\\n2013 study of internal controls requirements.\\\\246\\\\ No commenters \\nopposed such a requirement. Disclosure of the ICFR auditor attestation \\nis currently required within the auditor's report on the financial \\nstatements and management's annual report on ICFR.\\\\247\\\\ After reviewing \\nthese comments, we are persuaded to add a check box to the cover pages \\nof Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F to indicate whether an ICFR auditor \\nattestation is included in the filing because we agree that more \\nprominent and easily accessible disclosure of this information would be \\nuseful to investors and market participants while imposing only minimal \\nburdens on issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\245\\\\ See notes 138 to 143 above and the accompanying text.\\n    \\\\246\\\\ See U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-13-582, Internal \\nControls: SEC Should Consider Requiring Companies to Disclose \\nWhether They Obtained an Auditor Attestation (July 2013) (``2013 GAO \\nStudy'').\\n    \\\\247\\\\ See Item 308 of Regulation S-K and PCAOB AS 3101.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Under the new rule, issuers will be required to include the check \\nbox on their cover pages in any annual report filed on or after the \\nfinal amendments' effective date.

Amendments To Increase the Public Float Transition Thresholds From \\n$50 Million to $60 Million and $500 Million to $560 Million and To Add \\nthe SRC Revenue Test to the Transition Threshold\\n\\n1. Proposed Amendments\\n    An issuer initially becomes an accelerated filer after it first \\nmeets certain conditions as of the end of its fiscal year, including \\nthat it had a public float of $75 million or more but less than $700 \\nmillion as of the last business day of its most recently completed \\nsecond fiscal quarter. An issuer initially becomes a large accelerated \\nfiler in a similar manner, including that it had a public float of $700 \\nmillion or more as of the last business day of its most recently \\ncompleted second fiscal quarter. Once the issuer becomes an accelerated \\nfiler, it will not become a non-accelerated filer unless it determines \\nat the end of a fiscal year that its public float had fallen below $50 \\nmillion on the last business day of its most recently completed second \\nfiscal quarter. Similarly, a large accelerated filer will remain one \\nunless its public float had fallen below $500 million on the last \\nbusiness day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. If \\nthe large accelerated filer's public float falls below $500 million but \\nis $50 million or more, it becomes an accelerated filer. Alternatively, \\nif the issuer's public float falls below $50 million, it becomes a non-\\naccelerated filer.\\\\252\\\\ The purpose of these transition thresholds is \\nto avoid situations in which an issuer frequently enters and exits \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer status due to small \\nfluctuations in its public float.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\252\\\\ For example, under the rules prior to these amendments, if \\nan issuer that is a non-accelerated filer determines at the end of \\nits fiscal year that it had a public float of $75 million or more, \\nbut less than $700 million, on the last business day of its most \\nrecently completed second fiscal quarter, it will become an \\naccelerated filer. On the last business day of its next fiscal year, \\nthe issuer must re-determine its public float to re-evaluate its \\nfiler status. If the accelerated filer's public float fell to $70 \\nmillion on the last business day of its most recently completed \\nsecond fiscal quarter, it would remain an accelerated filer because \\nits public float did not fall below the $50 million transition \\nthreshold. Alternatively, if the issuer's public float fell to $49 \\nmillion, it would then become a non-accelerated filer because its \\nnewly determined public float is below $50 million. As another \\nexample, an issuer that has not been a large accelerated filer but \\nhad a public float of $700 million or more on the last business day \\nof its most recently completed second fiscal quarter would then \\nbecome a large accelerated filer at the end of its fiscal year. If, \\non the last business day of its subsequently completed second fiscal \\nquarter, the issuer's public float fell to $600 million, it would \\nremain a large accelerated filer because its public float did not \\nfall below $500 million. If, however, the issuer's public float fell \\nto $490 million at the end of its most recently completed second \\nfiscal quarter, it would become an accelerated filer at the end of \\nthe fiscal year because its public float fell below $500 million. \\nSimilarly, if the issuer's public float fell to $49 million, the \\nissuer would become a non-accelerated filer.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the SRC Adopting Release,\\\\253\\\\ we amended the SRC rules so that \\nthe SRC transition thresholds were set at 80 percent of the \\ncorresponding initial qualification thresholds. In the Proposing \\nRelease, we proposed to revise the accelerated and large accelerated \\nfiler transition thresholds to be 80 percent of the corresponding \\ninitial qualification thresholds to align the transition thresholds \\nacross the SRC, accelerated filer, and large accelerated filer \\ndefinitions. Additionally, we indicated that revising these thresholds \\nwould limit the cases in which an issuer could be both an accelerated \\nfiler and an SRC or a large accelerated filer and an SRC, thereby \\nreducing regulatory complexity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\253\\\\ See note 12 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We proposed to revise the transition threshold for becoming a non-\\naccelerated filer from $50 million to $60 million and the transition \\nthreshold for leaving the large accelerated filer status from $500 \\nmillion to $560 million. We also proposed to add the SRC revenue test \\nto the public float transition thresholds for accelerated and large \\naccelerated filers. If the SRC revenue test were not added to the \\naccelerated filer and large accelerated filer transition provisions, an \\nissuer's annual revenues would never factor into determining whether an \\naccelerated filer could become a non-accelerated filer, or whether a \\nlarge accelerated filer could become an accelerated or non-accelerated \\nfiler. We proposed that an issuer that is already an accelerated filer \\nwould remain one unless either its public float falls below $60 million \\nor it becomes eligible to use the SRC accommodations under the revenue \\ntest in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(B) of the SRC definition,\\\\254\\\\ as \\napplicable.\\\\255\\\\ Therefore, under the proposed amendments, an \\naccelerated filer would remain an accelerated filer until its public \\nfloat falls below $60 million or its annual revenues fall below the\\n\\n[[Page 17192]]\\n\\napplicable revenue threshold ($80 million or $100 million), at which \\npoint it would become a non-accelerated filer.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\254\\\\ Paragraph (2) of the SRC definition states that an issuer \\nqualifies as an SRC if its annual revenues are less than $100 \\nmillion and it has no public float or a public float of less than \\n$700 million. Paragraph (3)(iii)(B) of the SRC definition states, \\namong other things, that an issuer that initially determines it does \\nnot qualify as an SRC because its annual revenues are $100 million \\nor more cannot become an SRC until its annual revenues fall below \\n$80 million.\\n    \\\\255\\\\ An issuer that is initially applying the SRC definition or \\npreviously qualified as an SRC would apply paragraph (2) of the SRC \\ndefinition. Once an issuer determines that it does not qualify for \\nSRC status, it would apply paragraph (3)(iii)(B) of the SRC \\ndefinition at its next annual determination.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Similarly, we proposed conforming amendments to the large \\naccelerated filer transition provisions for when an issuer that is \\nalready a large accelerated filer transitions to either accelerated or \\nnon-accelerated filer status. To transition out of large accelerated \\nfiler status at the end of the issuer's fiscal year, an issuer would \\nneed to have a public float below $560 million as of the last business \\nday of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or meet the \\nrevenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(B), as applicable, of the SRC \\ndefinition. A large accelerated filer would become an accelerated filer \\nat the end of its fiscal year if its public float fell to $60 million \\nor more but less than $560 million as of the last business day of its \\nmost recently completed second fiscal quarter and its annual revenues \\nare not below the applicable revenue threshold ($80 million or $100 \\nmillion). The large accelerated filer would become a non-accelerated \\nfiler if its public float fell below $60 million as of the last \\nbusiness day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or \\nits annual revenues fell below the applicable revenue threshold ($80 \\nmillion or $100 million).\\\\256\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\256\\\\ One exception to this requirement is that an issuer that \\nwas a large accelerated filer whose public float had fallen below \\n$700 million (but remained $560 million or more) but became eligible \\nto be an SRC under the SRC revenue test in the first year the SRC \\namendments became effective would become a non-accelerated filer \\neven though its public float remained at or above $560 million. See \\nSRC Adopting Release, note 12 above, at n. 31 (``For purposes of the \\nfirst fiscal year ending after effectiveness of the amendments, a \\nregistrant will qualify as a SRC if it meets one of the initial \\nqualification thresholds in the revised definition as of the date it \\nis required to measure its public float or revenues (the \\n`measurement date'), even if such registrant previously did not \\nqualify as a SRC.'').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Comments\\n    We received very few comments regarding the proposed changes to the \\ntransition thresholds. The commenters who discussed the proposed \\namendments to increase the public float transition thresholds supported \\nthem.\\\\257\\\\ One commenter also suggested that the Commission consider \\nindexing the thresholds to inflation in a manner similar to the \\nindexing that applies to the EGC definition.\\\\258\\\\ Only two commenters \\naddressed the proposed amendments to add the SRC revenue test to the \\ntransition thresholds, and these commenters supported that \\nproposal.\\\\259\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\257\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CLSA, Nasdaq, and RSM.\\n    \\\\258\\\\ See letter from RSM.\\n    \\\\259\\\\ See letters from CLSA and Nasdaq.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Final Amendments\\n    After considering the comments, we are adopting the final \\namendments as proposed. As discussed in greater detail in the Economic \\nAnalysis,\\\\260\\\\ transition thresholds in Rule 12b-2 are lower than entry \\nthresholds to keep issuers from frequently needing to reclassify their \\nfiler status. The frequent reclassifications that would result without \\nthe transition thresholds may cause confusion for issuers and investors \\nas to the issuer's status. Also, such frequent reclassifications may \\nincrease issuers' costs because they would frequently need to revise \\ntheir disclosure schedules and continually consider the impact of \\nwhether they are subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nfrom one year to the next, and may increase investors' incremental \\ncosts of evaluating the reliability of the issuer's financial \\ndisclosures. Therefore, we believe a transition threshold is \\nappropriate. However, we recognize that providing a transition \\nthreshold results in some issuers remaining in their filer status even \\nthough their public float or revenues are below that filer status's \\nentry threshold.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\260\\\\ See Section IV.C.4.c below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The final amendments revise the public float transition threshold \\nfor accelerated and large accelerated filers to become a non-\\naccelerated filer from $50 million to $60 million and revise the public \\nfloat transition threshold for a large accelerated filer to lose its \\nlarge accelerated filer status from $500 million to $560 million. Prior \\nto the final amendments, the public float threshold for an accelerated \\nand large accelerated filer to become a non-accelerated filer was $50 \\nmillion and the public float transition threshold for a large \\naccelerated filer to lose its large accelerated filer status was $500 \\nmillion. We believe these threshold amounts are too low and result in \\nmore issuers than intended being classified as an accelerated or large \\naccelerated filer. However, we believe there should be some transition \\nthreshold so as to avoid some volatility. The amendments would make the \\npublic float transition thresholds 80 percent of the initial \\nthresholds, which is consistent with the percentage used in the \\ntransition thresholds for SRC eligibility. We believe this approach \\nappropriately balances the risk of frequent reclassifications resulting \\nfrom a higher percentage threshold against the risk of delaying \\nappropriate transitions due to a lower threshold. The table below \\nsummarizes how an issuer's filer status will change based on its \\nsubsequent public float determination.\\n\\n         Table 3--Subsequent Determination of Filer Status Based on Public Float Under Final Amendments\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                 Final amendments to the public float thresholds\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                Subsequent public float\\n  Initial public float determination    Resulting filer status        determination       Resulting filer status\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n$700 million or more.................

Non-Accelerated Filer.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n[[Page 17193]]\\n\\n    The final amendments also add the SRC revenue test to the \\ntransition threshold for accelerated and large accelerated filers. As \\nwe noted in the Proposing Release, if we do not add the SRC revenue \\ntest to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer transition \\nprovisions, an issuer's annual revenues would never factor into \\ndetermining whether an accelerated filer could become a non-accelerated \\nfiler, or whether a large accelerated filer could become an accelerated \\nor non-accelerated filer. We note that one commenter stated that the \\nmanner in which issuers may recognize revenue could cause them to \\nfrequently lose and gain non-accelerated filer status.\\\\261\\\\ We believe \\nthat providing transition thresholds should mitigate any such concern.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\261\\\\ See letter from EY.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Under the final amendments, an accelerated filer with revenues of \\n$100 million or more that is eligible to be an SRC based on the public \\nfloat test contained in paragraphs (1) and (3)(iii)(A) of the SRC \\ndefinition can transition to non-accelerated filer status in a \\nsubsequent year if it has revenues of less than $100 million. For \\nexample, an issuer with a December 31 fiscal year end that did not \\nexceed the public float threshold in the prior year and that has a \\npublic float, as of June 30, 2020, of $230 million and annual revenues \\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 of $101 million will be \\neligible to be an SRC under the public float test; however, because the \\nissuer would not be eligible to be an SRC under the SRC revenue test, \\nit will be an accelerated filer (assuming the other conditions \\ndescribed in Table 1 are also met). At the next determination date \\n(June 30, 2021), if its public float, as of June 30, 2020, remains at \\n$230 million and its annual revenues for the fiscal year ended December \\n31, 2019 are less than $100 million, the issuer will be eligible to be \\nan SRC under the SRC revenue test (in addition to the public float \\ntest) and thus it will become a non-accelerated filer.\\n    On the other hand, an issuer with a December 31 fiscal year end \\nthat has a public float, as of June 30, 2020, of $400 million and \\nannual revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 of $101 \\nmillion will not be eligible to be an SRC under either the public float \\ntest or the SRC revenue test and will be an accelerated filer (assuming \\nthe other conditions described in Table 1 also are met). At the next \\ndetermination date (June 30, 2021), if its public float, as of June 30, \\n2021, remains at $400 million, that issuer will not be eligible to be \\nan SRC under the SRC revenue test unless its annual revenues for the \\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2020 are less than $80 million, at which \\npoint it will be eligible to be an SRC under the SRC revenue test and \\nto become a non-accelerated filer.\\n\\nD. Transition Issues\\n\\n    The final amendments will become effective 30 days after they are \\npublished in the Federal Register. The final amendments will apply to \\nan annual report filing due on or after the effective date. Even if \\nthat annual report is for a fiscal year ending before the effective \\ndate, the issuer may apply the final amendments to determine its status \\nas a non-accelerated, accelerated, or large accelerated filer. For \\nexample, an issuer that has a March 31, 2020 fiscal year end and that \\nis due to file its annual report after the effective date of the \\namendments may apply the final amendments to determine its filing \\nstatus even though its fiscal year end date precedes the effective \\ndate. An issuer that determines it is eligible to be a non-accelerated \\nfiler under the final amendments will not be subject to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement for its annual report due and submitted \\nafter the effective date of the amendments and may comply with the \\nfiling deadlines that apply, and other accommodations available, to \\nnon-accelerated filers.\\n\\nIII. Other Matters\\n\\n    If any of the provisions of these amendments, or the application of \\nthese provisions to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, \\nsuch invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of \\nsuch provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given \\neffect without the invalid provision or application. Pursuant to the \\nCongressional Review Act,\\\\262\\\\ the Office of Information and Regulatory \\nAffairs has designated these amendments as not ``a major rule,'' as \\ndefined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\262\\\\ 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIV. Economic Analysis\\n\\n    We are mindful of the costs and benefits of the amendments. The \\ndiscussion below addresses the economic effects of the amendments, \\nincluding their anticipated costs and benefits, as well as the likely \\neffects of the amendments on efficiency, competition, and capital \\nformation.\\\\263\\\\ We also analyze the potential costs and benefits of \\nreasonable alternatives to the amendments. Where practicable, we have \\nattempted to quantify the economic effects of the amendments; however, \\nin certain cases, we are unable to do so because either the necessary \\ndata are unavailable or certain effects are not quantifiable. In these \\ncases, we provide a qualitative assessment of the likely economic \\neffects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\263\\\\ Section 2(b), 15 U.S.C. 77b(b), and Section 3(f) of the \\nExchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(f), directs the Commission, when \\nengaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine \\nwhether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public \\ninterest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, \\nwhether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital \\nformation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \\n78w(a)(2), requires the Commission, when making rules under the \\nExchange Act, to consider the impact that the rules would have on \\ncompetition, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule \\nthat would impose a burden on competition not necessary or \\nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA. Introduction\\n\\n    As discussed above, we are adopting amendments to the definitions \\nof ``accelerated filer'' and ``large accelerated filer'' that will \\ngenerally extend non-accelerated filer status to issuers with up to \\n$700 million in public float if they are eligible to be SRCs and their \\nrevenues are less than $100 million. As non-accelerated filers, among \\nother things, these issuers will not be required to obtain an ICFR \\nauditor attestation pursuant to SOX Section 404(b). The amendments are \\nintended to reduce compliance costs for these issuers while maintaining \\ninvestor protections by more appropriately tailoring the types of \\nissuers that are included in the categories of accelerated and large \\naccelerated filers.\\n    In the Proposing Release, we presented evidence that the imposition \\nof the ICFR auditor attestation requirement has been associated with \\nbenefits to issuers and investors, such as reduced rates of ineffective \\nICFR and more reliable financial statements.\\\\264\\\\ However, as explained \\nin the Proposing Release, the affected issuers may find the costs of \\nthis requirement to be particularly burdensome given certain fixed \\ncosts that may not scale with size. Importantly, because these issuers \\nhave limited access to internally-generated capital, savings on \\ncompliance costs may be more likely to be applied to additional \\ninvestment, research, or hiring.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\264\\\\ See Section III.C.4.a. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove,. See also Section IV.C.3.a. below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We acknowledged, in the Proposing Release, that exempting these \\nlow-revenue issuers from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement may \\nresult in adverse effects such as an increased prevalence of \\nineffective ICFR and\\n\\n[[Page 17194]]\\n\\nrestatements, and we estimated the potential effects on the rates of \\nsuch issues among the affected issuers. At the same time, we provided \\nevidence in support of two mitigating factors specific to the affected \\nissuers.\\\\265\\\\ First, we documented that low-revenue issuers have \\nrelatively low rates of restatement, which could mean that the affected \\nissuers may, on average, be less susceptible to the risk of certain \\nkinds of misstatements. Next, we provided evidence that the market \\nvalue of the low-revenue issuers was not as associated with \\ncontemporary financial statements as for higher-revenue issuers, which \\ncould imply that their valuations are driven to a greater degree by \\ntheir future prospects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\265\\\\ We also noted in the Proposing Release, note 4 above, that \\nissuers exempted from this requirement may choose to voluntarily \\nobtain an ICFR auditor attestation if investors demand it or the \\nissuers otherwise deem it, from their perspective, to be the best \\nuse of their resources.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Commenters raised a number of concerns with our analysis and \\nconclusions in the Proposing Release. We carefully reviewed all of the \\ncomments received and in a few instances, conducted supplemental \\nanalysis in response to the issues and questions raised by those \\ncomments. Overall, based on our analysis of the available evidence and \\ndata, our primary conclusions have not substantively changed. While we \\naddress the comments in detail in the body of the Economic Analysis \\nbelow, we highlight certain of our findings in relation to some \\ncommenter concerns here.\\n    One concern raised by commenters is that rather than targeting \\nissuers where there may be relatively fewer benefits of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement, the amendments will remove this \\nrequirement for exactly those issuers where the benefits may be \\ngreatest.\\\\266\\\\ These commenters supported this assertion by, for \\nexample, claiming that investors react more strongly to news of \\nrestatements or material weaknesses in ICFR--and thus care more about \\nthe benefits of an ICFR auditor attestation--at small or low-revenue \\nissuers as compared to other issuers.\\\\267\\\\ In response to these \\ncomments, we have conducted additional analyses of the investor \\nresponse to ICFR disclosures and restatement announcements. We do not \\nfind any evidence that investors react more negatively to restatements \\nor to auditors reporting material weaknesses in ICFR at low-revenue \\nissuers than at higher-revenue issuers. Further, based on the \\nsuggestions of a commenter,\\\\268\\\\ we have refined our analysis of the \\nextent to which financial statement variables are associated with the \\nvaluation of different types of issuers. We continue to find that \\nfinancial statement variables explain a greater amount of the variation \\nin stock prices and returns for higher-revenue issuers than for low-\\nrevenue issuers, even when we focus on more seasoned issuers similar to \\nthose that would be affected by the amendments or when we expand the \\nset of variables that we consider. Overall, our analysis does not \\nprovide support for the assertion that investors care more about the \\ninformation produced by the ICFR auditor attestation requirement at \\nlow-revenue issuers than at other issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\266\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., and CII. See also \\nCommissioner Jackson's Statement.\\n    \\\\267\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\268\\\\ See letter from Crowe.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    A few commenters asserted that the costs of the amendments will \\nsignificantly outweigh any benefits.\\\\269\\\\ We have conducted \\nsupplemental analysis and quantification of the potential costs of the \\namendments and do not find evidence to support the views of these \\ncommenters. We carefully considered the cost estimates provided by \\ncommenters and found them useful in refining our own analysis. However, \\nwe found some of these estimates to be overstated. For example, some \\nestimates applied costs associated with a small fraction of issuers to \\nall of the affected issuers or implicitly compared aggregate estimates \\nof costs over multiple years to the estimated savings for a single \\nyear.\\\\270\\\\ Others identified investor harms that occurred despite the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement being in place, which may \\ndemonstrate the limitations of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nrather than informing us of the risks of removing the requirement.\\\\271\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\269\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets and Prof. Barth et \\nal.\\n    \\\\270\\\\ See letter from Prof. Barth et al. (with respect to \\nquantified benefits of ICFR audit for the average company).\\n    \\\\271\\\\ See letters from Better Markets and Prof. Barth et al. \\n(with respect to estimates of income and stock market impact of \\nrestatements).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Some commenters stated that the Proposing Release did not provide \\nsufficient quantification of the costs of the amendments.\\\\272\\\\ In \\nresponse to those comments, as additional context for our consideration \\nof the possible effects of the final amendments, we conducted \\nsupplemental analysis of the expected frequency, type, and magnitude of \\npotential adverse effects. We consider effects resulting from potential \\nmisreporting about the effectiveness of ICFR as well as those driven by \\npotential changes in the actual effectiveness of ICFR. Where possible, \\nwe estimate dollar costs as well as dollar transfers across \\nshareholders, which represent costs to some shareholders and benefits \\nto other shareholders. We note that these cost estimates do not fully \\nadjust for the mitigating factors that we find to be associated with \\nlow-revenue issuers and may therefore be inflated. Also, we caution \\nagainst attempts to over-interpret the relation between our \\nquantitative estimates of monetized benefits and monetized costs \\nbecause we are not able to place dollar values on all of the potential \\ncosts and benefits of the amendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\272\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CFA Inst., CII, \\nProf. Barth et al., and Prof. Ge et al.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters argued that the expected cost savings are too \\nsmall to be economically meaningful,\\\\273\\\\ and that the amendments are \\nunlikely to have capital formation benefits.\\\\274\\\\ We acknowledge that, \\nwhile the amendments could be a positive factor in the decision of \\nadditional companies to enter public markets, it may not be the \\ndecisive factor, and the direct impact of the amendments on the number \\nof public companies may be limited to the extent that companies may be \\nmore focused on other factors associated with the decision to go \\npublic. However, we continue to believe that the expected savings is \\nlikely, in many cases, to represent a meaningful cost savings for the \\naffected issuers.\\\\275\\\\ In particular, while the average annual cost \\nsavings may represent a small percentage of the average affected \\nissuers' revenues and market capitalizations, it is still likely to be \\nmeaningful given that the net income and operating cash flows of the \\naffected issuers are typically negative.\\\\276\\\\ These savings may thus \\nhave beneficial economic effects on net capital formation through the \\nproductive use of\\n\\n[[Page 17195]]\\n\\nthis preserved capital towards, for example, new investments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\273\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., CII, and Prof. \\nBarth et al.\\n    \\\\274\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CII, CFA, CFA \\nInst., and Prof. Ge et al.\\n    \\\\275\\\\ One commenter requested that we replicate, with recent \\ndata, the analysis in a previous study that found a ``bunching'' of \\nfirms below the public float threshold for entering accelerated \\nfiler status, in order to explore whether the costs of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement remain as high as previously \\ndocumented. See letter from Prof. Honigsberg, et al. See also \\nCommissioner Jackson's Statement. As discussed in more detail below, \\nwe provide this analysis and find that there may be some such \\n``bunching,'' but we note that our conclusion that the cost savings \\nmay be meaningful to the affected issuers does not rely on this \\nanalysis or the related study.\\n    \\\\276\\\\ See note 362 below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Some commenters indicated that the Proposing Release did not \\nadequately consider the risk of fraud,\\\\277\\\\ or that the risks of \\nfraudulent financial reporting may be particularly high for low-revenue \\nissuers.\\\\278\\\\ We acknowledge the argument that incentives to engage in \\nmisconduct could be different for low-revenue issuers and, in response \\nto these comments, we conducted supplemental analysis concerning the \\nrisk of fraud. In particular, we conducted an analysis to investigate \\nthis risk and did not find evidence based on the available data that \\nlow-revenue issuers that, like the affected issuers, are not within \\nfive years of their IPO (``seasoned'' issuers), are more highly \\nrepresented in the set of seasoned issuers associated with financial \\nmisconduct or financial reporting fraud than they are in the overall \\npopulation of seasoned issuers.We also estimated the extent to which \\nexpanding the exemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\ncould affect the likelihood of the affected issuers engaging in such \\nactivities and include a quantification of the associated costs of this \\nrisk in our overall assessment of the potential costs of the \\namendments. Overall, this supplemental analysis does not cause us to \\nchange our primary conclusions regarding the potential effects of the \\namendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\277\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst., CII, and Prof. Barth et \\nal.\\n    \\\\278\\\\ See, e.g., letter from CFA, CFA Inst., CII and Prof. Barth \\net al.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The economic analysis also considers other changes associated with \\nthe amendments. For example, the affected issuers will be permitted an \\nadditional 15 days and five days, respectively, after the end of each \\nperiod to file their annual and quarterly reports, relative to the \\ndeadlines that apply to accelerated filers.\\\\279\\\\ The amendments also \\nrevise the transition provisions for accelerated and large accelerated \\nfiler status, including increasing the public float thresholds to exit \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer status from $50 million and \\n$500 million in public float to $60 million and $560 million in public \\nfloat. Additionally, the amendments introduce a new check-box \\ndisclosure on the cover page of annual reports on Forms 10-K, 20-F, and \\n40-F to indicate whether an ICFR auditor attestation is included in the \\nfiling.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\279\\\\ Non-accelerated filers also are not required to provide \\ndisclosure required by Item 1B of Form 10-K and Item 4A of Form 20-F \\nabout unresolved staff comments on their periodic and/or current \\nreports or disclosure required by Item 101(e)(4) of Regulation S-K \\nabout whether they make filings available on or through their \\ninternet websites.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The discussion that follows examines the potential benefits and \\ncosts of the amendments in detail. As part of our analysis, we consider \\nboth the comments received on the Proposing Release and the likelihood \\nthat the effects of the ICFR auditor attestation have changed over time \\nwith changes in auditing standards and other market conditions.\\n\\nB. Baseline\\n\\n    To assess the economic impact of the amendments, we are using as \\nour baseline the current state of the market under the existing \\ndefinition of ``accelerated filer.'' This section discusses the current \\nregulatory requirements and market practices. It also provides \\nstatistics characterizing accelerated filers, the timing of filings, \\ndisclosures about ineffective ICFR, and restatement rates under the \\nbaseline.\\n1. Regulatory Baseline\\n    Our baseline includes existing statutes and Commission rules that \\ngovern the responsibilities of issuers with respect to financial \\nreporting, as well as PCAOB auditing standards and market standards \\nrelated to the implementation of these responsibilities.\\n    In particular, accelerated and large accelerated filers are subject \\nto accelerated filing deadlines for their periodic reports relative to \\nnon-accelerated filers. These deadlines are summarized in Table 4 \\nbelow. All registrants can file Form 12b-25 (``Form NT'') to avail \\nthemselves of an additional 15 calendar days to file an annual report, \\nor an additional five calendar days to file a quarterly report, and \\nstill have their report deemed to have been timely filed.\\n\\n             Table 4--Filing Deadlines for Periodic Reports\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                    Calendar days after\\n                                                        period end\\n                Category of filer                -----------------------\\n                                                    Annual     Quarterly\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNon-Accelerated Filer...........................          90          45\\nAccelerated Filer...............................          75          40\\nLarge Accelerated Filer.........................          60          40\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Proposing Release discusses in detail the issuer and auditor \\nresponsibilities with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and \\nICFR for issuers of different filer types.\\\\280\\\\ These responsibilities \\nderive from the FCPA requirements with respect to internal accounting \\ncontrols as well as a number of different changes to financial \\nreporting that were introduced by SOX.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\280\\\\ See Sections II.B. and III.B.1. of the Proposing Release, \\nnote 4 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In particular, all issuers \\\\281\\\\ are required to devise and \\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls \\\\282\\\\ and \\nto have their corporate officers assess the effectiveness of the \\nissuer's disclosure controls and procedures \\\\283\\\\ and disclose the \\nconclusions of their assessments, typically on a quarterly basis.\\\\284\\\\ \\nIn addition, all issuers are required to have their corporate officers \\ncertify in each of their periodic reports that the information in the \\nreport fairly presents, in all material respects, the issuer's \\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\\\285\\\\ All issuers other \\nthan RICs and asset-backed securities (``ABS'') issuers \\\\286\\\\ are also \\nrequired to include management's assessment of the effectiveness of \\ntheir ICFR in their annual reports.\\\\287\\\\ Further, all issuers are \\nrequired to have the financial statements in their annual reports \\nexamined and reported on by an independent auditor, who, even if not \\nengaged to provide an ICFR auditor attestation, is responsible for \\nconsidering ICFR in the performance of the financial statement \\naudit.\\\\288\\\\ Also, an auditor engaged in a financial statement only \\naudit may test the operating effectiveness of some internal controls in \\norder to reduce the extent of substantive testing performed in the \\naudit. Importantly, all of these responsibilities with respect to \\nfinancial reporting and ICFR apply equally to\\n\\n[[Page 17196]]\\n\\nnon-accelerated as well as accelerated and large accelerated filers. \\nFinally, all issuers listed on national exchanges are required to have \\nan audit committee that is composed solely of independent directors and \\nis directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention \\nand oversight of the issuer's independent auditors.\\\\289\\\\ The amendments \\ndo not change any of these requirements, including the requirements of \\na financial statement audit.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\281\\\\ Specifically, the requirements apply to all issuers that \\nfile reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\\n    \\\\282\\\\ See Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.\\n    \\\\283\\\\ See note 209 above.\\n    \\\\284\\\\ See note 210 above.\\n    \\\\285\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.13a-14(b) and 17 CFR 240.15d-14(b).\\n    \\\\286\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 17 CFR 240.15d-15. A newly \\npublic issuer is also not required to provide a SOX Section 404(a) \\nmanagement report on ICFR until its second annual report filed with \\nthe Commission. See Instructions to Item 308 of Regulation S-K.\\n    \\\\287\\\\ See Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial \\nReporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic \\nReports, Release No. 33-8238 (June 5, 2003) [68 FR 36635 (June 18, \\n2003)]. These evaluations of ICFR, as well as any associated ICFR \\nauditor attestations, should be based on a suitable, recognized \\ncontrol framework. The most widely used framework for this purpose \\nis the one set forth in a report of the Committee of Sponsoring \\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (``COSO'').\\n    \\\\288\\\\ See PCAOB AS 2110, note 187 above. See also the discussion \\nbelow in this section about this auditing standard.\\n    \\\\289\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.10A-3. In the absence of an ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement, we note that the audit committee is \\nresponsible for approving whether to voluntarily obtain an ICFR \\nauditor attestation, and would be alerted by the auditor engaged in \\na financial statement only audit if the auditor becomes aware of a \\nsignificant deficiency or material weakness in ICFR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Beyond these requirements, accelerated filers and large accelerated \\nfilers other than EGCs, RICs, and ABS issuers are required under SOX \\nSection 404(b) and related rules to include an ICFR auditor attestation \\nin their annual reports. In addition, certain banks, even if they are \\nnon-accelerated filers, are required under Federal Deposit Insurance \\nCorporation (``FDIC'') rules to have their auditor attest to, and \\nreport on, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the bank's \\nICFR (the ``FDIC auditor attestation requirement'').\\\\290\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\290\\\\ Part 363 of the FDIC regulations requires that the auditor \\nof an insured depository institution with consolidated total assets \\nof $1 billion or more (as of the beginning of the fiscal year) \\nexamine, attest to, and report separately on the assertion of \\nmanagement concerning the effectiveness of the institution's \\ninternal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    One commenter raised questions about the nature of the FDIC auditor \\nattestation requirement and how it compares to the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement.\\\\291\\\\ For banks that are subject to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement, the FDIC regulations require ICFR \\nattestation engagements to be performed according to the same standards \\nas the ICFR auditor attestation requirement under SOX Section 404(b) \\n(i.e., AS 2201,\\\\292\\\\ as discussed below).\\\\293\\\\ For other banks, the \\nFDIC allows ICFR attestations to be performed either according to AS \\n2201 or according to the American Institute of Certified Public \\nAccountants (``AICPA'') attestation standard.\\\\294\\\\ In 2015, the \\nAuditing Standards Board of the AICPA issued Statement on Auditing \\nStandards (``SAS'') No. 130, revising their attestation standard with \\nthe intention of adhering as closely as possible to AS 2201 while \\naligning with their generally accepted auditing standards and avoiding \\nunintended consequences in practice.\\\\295\\\\ The FDIC also requires that \\nthe attestation reports be made available for public inspection (at the \\nbank's main and branch offices or, alternatively, by mail to anyone who \\nrequests it).\\\\296\\\\ Per Section IV.B.4 below, material weaknesses \\nreported in SOX Section 404(a) reports and the corresponding SOX \\nSection 404(b) reports typically mirror each other, so material \\nweaknesses identified by the FDIC auditor attestation may also become \\npublicly known via corresponding SOX Section 404(a) management reports. \\nFinally, we note that FDIC and Federal Reserve examiners may also \\nindependently review and assess the adequacy of ICFR of banks.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\291\\\\ See letter from CFA Inst.\\n    \\\\292\\\\ See AS 2201, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial \\nReporting That Is Integrated with An Audit of Financial Statements \\n(``AS 2201'').\\n    \\\\293\\\\ See Section 18A of Appendix A to Part 363 of the FDIC \\nregulations.\\n    \\\\294\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\295\\\\ See Executive Summary to SAS 130 (October 2015), available \\nat \\nhttps://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/SAS_130_Summary.pdf\\n.\\n    \\\\296\\\\ See Section 363.4 of Part 363 of the FDIC regulations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Some issuers that are not required to comply with SOX Section \\n404(b) voluntarily obtain an ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\297\\\\ Estimates \\nof the number of issuers of each filer type are provided in Table 5 \\nbelow.\\\\298\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\297\\\\ Up to about seven percent of exempt issuers voluntarily \\nprovided an ICFR auditor attestation from 2005 through 2011. See \\n2013 GAO Study, note 246 above. We find similar results when \\nexamining data for non-accelerated filers and EGCs in calendar years \\n2014 through 2018 from Ives Group Audit Analytics to identify, among \\nissuers of these types that have a SOX Section 404(a) management \\nreport, how many also have an ICFR auditor attestation report \\navailable in the database. See note 298 below regarding the \\nidentification of filer types.\\n    \\\\298\\\\ The estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of \\nself-identified filer status for issuers filing annual reports on \\nForms 10-K, 20-F, or 40-F in calendar year 2018, excluding any such \\nfilings that pertain to fiscal years prior to 2017. Staff extracted \\nfiler status from filings using a computer program supplemented with \\nhand collection and compared the results for robustness with data \\nfrom XBRL filings, Ives Group Audit Analytics, and Calcbench. FPIs \\nrepresent those filing on Forms 20-F or 40-F and do not include FPIs \\nthat choose to file on Form 10-K. EGC issuers are identified by \\nusing data from Ives Group Audit Analytics and/or by using a \\ncomputer program to search issuer filings, including filings other \\nthan annual reports, for a statement regarding EGC status. The \\nestimates generally exclude RICs because these issuers do not file \\non the annual report types considered.

In \\nparticular, the risk assessment standards applying to both types of \\naudits require auditors, in either case, to evaluate the design of \\ncertain controls, including whether the controls are implemented.\\\\310\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\309\\\\ See PCAOB Release No. 2010-004 and PCAOB Release No. 2010-\\n01, note 193 above.\\n    \\\\310\\\\ See AS 2110, paragraphs .18-.40, note 187 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Based on the results of inspections in the several years after the \\nadoption of the new risk assessment auditing standards, the PCAOB \\nexpressed concern about the number and significance of deficiencies in \\nauditing firm compliance with these standards, but also noted promising \\nimprovements in the application of these standards.\\\\311\\\\ While the risk \\nassessment standards may reduce the degree of difference between a \\nfinancial statement only audit and an integrated audit, there remain \\nimportant differences in the requirements of these audits as they \\nrelate to controls. For example, in an integrated audit, but not a \\nfinancial statement only audit, the auditor is required to identify \\nlikely sources of misstatements in considering the evaluation of \\nICFR.\\\\312\\\\ Also, the extent of the procedures necessary to obtain the \\nrequired understanding of controls generally will be greater in an \\nintegrated audit due to the different objectives of such an audit as \\ncompared to a financial statement only audit.\\\\313\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\311\\\\ See PCAOB Release No. 2015-007, note 195 above.\\n    \\\\312\\\\ See PCAOB Release No. 2010-004, note 309 above, at 7 and \\nA10-41. As discussed above, even in a financial statement only \\naudit, if the auditor becomes aware of a significant deficiency or \\nmaterial weakness in ICFR, it is required to inform management and \\nthe audit committee of this finding and has the responsibility to \\nreview management's disclosure for any misstatement of facts, such \\nas a statement that ICFR is effective when there is a known material \\nweakness. See notes 190 to 191 above and the accompanying text.\\n    \\\\313\\\\ See Proposed Auditing Standards Related to the Auditor's \\nAssessment of and Response to Risk and Conforming Amendments to \\nPCAOB Standards, PCAOB Release No. 2008-006 A9-8 (Oct. 21, 2008).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Commission recently settled charges against four public \\ncompanies for failing to maintain effective ICFR for seven to 10 \\nconsecutive annual reporting periods.\\\\314\\\\ These enforcement cases may \\nhave a deterrent effect among issuers failing to remediate material \\nweaknesses, which might reduce the overall rate of persistence of \\nmaterial weaknesses in ICFR.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\314\\\\ See SEC Press Release, note 196 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We also note that there have been some recent changes in accounting \\nand auditing that are part of our baseline and could increase the \\nuncertainty of our analysis due to their effects on factors such as \\naudit fees, restatements, and ICFR. For example, three new reporting \\nstandards have been issued recently by FASB, on the topics of revenue \\nrecognition, leases, and credit losses, which could temporarily \\nincrease audit fees as issuers and auditors adjust to the new \\nstandards.\\\\315\\\\ Recent changes in technology, such as the potential for \\nmanagement to use automated controls testing and process \\nautomation,\\\\316\\\\ may result in improvements in ICFR regardless of the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement if their increased application \\nresults in more robust financial reporting processes with fewer \\nopportunities for deficiencies and/or in an increase by\\n\\n[[Page 17198]]\\n\\nmanagement in control testing and related improvements. Such automation \\ncould also reduce audit fees, including the costs of an audit of ICFR, \\nbut at least one report suggests that the uptake of these technologies \\nhas been slow.\\\\317\\\\ Finally, auditors have had many years of experience \\nwith integrated audits, as well as risk assessment standards that \\nrequire the consideration of ICFR even in the absence of an ICFR \\nauditor attestation. This experience may affect their execution of \\nfinancial statement only audits of issuers for whom the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement is eliminated. For example, given their \\nexperience, auditors may be more likely to detect control deficiencies \\nor to increase their auditing efficiency by reducing substantive \\ntesting in favor of testing some related controls even when an ICFR \\nauditor attestation is not required.\\\\318\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\315\\\\ Information on these and other FASB Accounting Standards \\nupdates is available at \\nhttps://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage&cid=1176156316498\\n.\\n    \\\\316\\\\ See, e.g., Robotic Process Automation, note 197 above.\\n    \\\\317\\\\ See, e.g., Protiviti survey results, Benchmarking SOX \\nCosts, Hours and Controls (2018) (``Protiviti 2018 Report'').\\n    \\\\318\\\\ 2011 SEC Staff Study, note 198 above, (stating that ``. . \\n. once effective controls are in place at the issuer, the auditor is \\nmore likely to continue to test them even if [it is] not issuing an \\nauditor attestation during a particular year in order to rely on \\nthem for purposes of reducing substantive testing in the audit of \\nthe financial statements, particularly for issuers that are larger \\nand more complex'').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2. Characteristics of Accelerated Filer Population\\n    Per Table 5, there were approximately 1,400 accelerated filers in \\ntotal in 2018. Figure 2 \\\\319\\\\ presents the distribution of public float \\nacross these issuers.\\\\320\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\319\\\\ The estimates in the figure are based on staff analysis of \\ndata from XBRL filings. See note 298 above for details on the \\nidentification of the population of accelerated filers.\\n    \\\\320\\\\ Because of the accelerated filer transition provisions, \\nsome accelerated filers have float below $75 million. The public \\nfloat of these issuers would previously have exceeded $75 million, \\ncausing them to enter accelerated filer status, but has not dropped \\nbelow the $50 million public float level required to exit \\naccelerated filer status.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBILLING CODE 8011-01-P\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MR20.001\\n\\nBILLING CODE 8011-01-C\\n    The distribution of public float among accelerated filers is skewed \\ntowards lower levels of float, but higher levels of float are also \\nsignificantly represented.\\n    Figure 3 \\\\321\\\\ presents the distribution of revenues across those \\naccelerated filers that have less than $1 billion in revenues. While \\nthe full population of accelerated filers has revenues of up to over \\n$20 billion, about 90 percent of accelerated filers have less than $1 \\nbillion in revenues. We restrict the figure to this subset in order to \\nmore clearly display the distribution in this range.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\321\\\\ The estimates of revenues are based on staff analysis of \\ndata from XBRL filings, Compustat, and Calcbench. The revenue data \\nused is from the last fiscal year prior to the annual report in \\ncalendar year 2018, because the SRC revenue test is based on the \\nprior year's revenues. See note 298 above for details on the \\nidentification of the population of accelerated filers.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 17199]]\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MR20.002\\n\\n    The distribution of revenues for accelerated filers is heavily \\nskewed towards lower levels of revenue, with roughly three-quarters of \\naccelerated filers having revenues of less than $500 million and more \\nthan a third having revenues of less than $100 million. Other than a \\nclustering of issuers with zero or near zero revenues, there are no \\nobvious breaks in the distribution.\\n    While a large range of industries are represented among accelerated \\nfilers, a small number of industries account for the majority of these \\nissuers. The ``Banking'' industry accounts for about 14.1 percent of \\naccelerated filers, followed by ``Pharmaceutical Products'' (13.9 \\npercent) ``Financial Trading'' (8.0 percent), ``Business Services'' \\n(5.7 percent), ``Petroleum and Natural Gas'' (4.8 percent), ``Computer \\nSoftware'' (4.4 percent), ``Retail'' (4.4 percent), ``Transportation'' \\n(4.2 percent), and ``Electronic Equipment'' (4.1 percent).\\\\322\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\322\\\\ These estimates are based on staff analysis of data \\nincluding SIC codes from XBRL filings and Ives Group Audit \\nAnalytics, using the Fama-French 49-industry classification system. \\nSee \\nhttp://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_49_ind_port.html\\n. See note 298 above for details on \\nidentification of population of accelerated filers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Timing of Filings\\n    As discussed above, non-accelerated, accelerated, and large \\naccelerated filers face different filing deadlines for their periodic \\nreports. In Table 6, we present the timing in recent years of annual \\nreport filings by these different groups of issuers relative to their \\ncorresponding deadlines.\\\\323\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\323\\\\ The estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of \\nEDGAR filings. These statistics include all annual reports on Forms \\n10-K, 20-F, and 40-F filed in calendar years 2014 through 2018 other \\nthan amendments. If multiple annual reports (excluding amendments) \\nare filed in the same calendar year, the analysis considers only the \\nlatest such filing. Given the effect of weekends and holidays, \\nfilings are considered to be on time if within two calendar days \\nafter the original deadline. The ``5 days early'' and ``over 15 days \\nafter'' categories are similarly adjusted to account for the \\npossible effect of weekends and holidays. See note 298 above for \\ndetails on the identification of filer type.\\n\\n              Table 6--Filing Timing for Annual Reports in Years 2014 Through 2018, by Filer Status\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                        Non-accelerated              Accelerated           Large  accelerated\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAnnual report filing deadline....  90 days..................  75 days.................  60 days.\\nAverage days to file.............  101 days.................  70 days.................  56 days.\\nPercentage filed:\\n    By deadline..................  72%......................  91%.....................  94%.\\n    Over 5 days early............  44%......................  63%.....................  61%.\\n    After deadline...............  28%......................  9%......................  6%.\\n    Over 15 days after deadline..  13%......................  5%......................  4%.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n[[Page 17200]]\\n\\n    Table 6 documents that accelerated and large accelerated filers \\nfile their annual reports, on average, four or five days before the \\napplicable deadline. Nine percent and six percent, respectively, of \\naccelerated and large accelerated filers submit their annual reports \\nafter the initial deadline, with roughly half of these filers \\nsurpassing the 15-day grace period that is obtained by filing Form NT. \\nNon-accelerated filers are less likely to meet their initial deadline \\nor extended deadline, with the average non-accelerated filer submitting \\nits annual report 11 days after the initial deadline and 13 percent of \\nnon-accelerated filers filing after the 15-day grace period obtained by \\nfiling Form NT.\\n4. Internal Controls and Restatements\\n    We next consider the current rates of ineffective ICFR and \\nrestatements \\\\324\\\\ among issuers that are accelerated filers under the \\nbaseline relative to other filer types. The data for all years of the \\nanalysis has been updated relative to the analysis in the Proposing \\nRelease.\\\\325\\\\ Throughout our analysis, we use the term restatement to \\nrefer to a restatement that is associated with some type of \\nmisstatement. As discussed above, non-accelerated filers and EGCs are \\nstatutorily exempted from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. \\nTable 7 presents the percentage of issuers reporting ineffective ICFR \\nin recent years by filer type.\\\\326\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\324\\\\ Unless otherwise specified, statistics and analysis \\nregarding restatements are not restricted to those restatements \\nrequiring Form 8-K Item 4.02 disclosure.\\n    \\\\325\\\\ Previous years of data may be revised due to, for example, \\nnewly disclosed restatements that reflect misstatements in these \\nearlier years, restated internal control reports that relate to \\nprevious fiscal years, previously incomplete data that was later \\npopulated, or other updates or database changes.\\n    \\\\326\\\\ The estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of \\nIves Group Audit Analytics data. ICFR effectiveness is based on the \\nlast amended management or auditor attestation report for the fiscal \\nyear. Percentages are computed out of all issuers of a given filer \\ntype with the specified type of report available in the Ives Group \\nAudit Analytics database.

Similarly, per the third \\ncolumn of Table 7, the average rate of ineffective ICFR for large \\naccelerated filers across years 2014 through 2018 was 4.1 percent as \\nreported in management reports and 4.1 percent as reported in \\nauditor reports.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We next consider the persistence of material weaknesses across \\nthese issuer categories. Table 8 \\\\331\\\\ presents the percentage of \\nissuers that reported two, three, or four consecutive years of \\nineffective ICFR culminating in 2018, by filer type.\\\\332\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\331\\\\ The estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of \\nIves Group Audit Analytics data.

Compared to non-accelerated \\nfilers, we find that a smaller percentage of accelerated and large \\naccelerated filers report material weaknesses that persist for multiple \\nyears, with about one percent of accelerated filers and about 0.3 \\npercent of large accelerated filers reporting ineffective ICFR for four \\nconsecutive years (per the third row of the table), representing about \\n11 percent of the accelerated filers and about seven percent of the \\nlarge accelerated filers that reported ineffective ICFR in 2018 (per \\nthe last row of the table). A larger percentage of non-accelerated \\nfilers persistently report material weaknesses, with about 16 percent \\nof these issuers (per the third row of the table), or about 40 percent \\nof those reporting ineffective ICFR in 2018 (per the last row of the \\ntable), having reported material weaknesses for four consecutive years. \\nAs discussed above, it is possible that recent Commission enforcement \\nactions might lead to a reduction in the persistence of material \\nweaknesses in ICFR to the extent that they change issuers' awareness of \\nthe risks of longstanding ICFR failures.\\n    Table 9 presents the rate of restatements among each of these filer \\ntypes, excluding EGCs, and for EGCs separately.

The reporting lag before \\nrestatements are filed results in a lower observed rate in the later \\nyears of our sample, particularly for 2017 (and even more so for 2018, \\nwhich we do not report for this reason), as issuers may yet restate \\ntheir results from recent years.\\\\333\\\\\\n\\n                  Table 9--Percentage of Issuers Issuing Restatements by Year of Restated Data\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                       Non-\\n                                                    accelerated     Accelerated        Large\\n                    Restated                        (ex.

The latter type of restatement (``Item 4.02 \\nrestatements'') reflects material misstatements, while other \\nrestatements deal with misstatements that are considered immaterial. We \\nfind that EGCs, which are not subject to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement and generally are also younger issuers than those in the \\nother groups, restate their financial statements at higher rates than \\nother issuers, whether we consider all restatements or only Item 4.02 \\nrestatements. For non-accelerated filers, which also are not subject to \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement, we find that the percentage \\nof issuers reporting Item 4.02 restatements is similar to, and the rate \\nof all restatements slightly lower than, that for accelerated filers \\nwho are subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. We note \\nthat there is a greater proportion of low-revenue issuers in the non-\\naccelerated filer category than in other categories, and that, in the \\nProposing Release, we found such issuers to have lower rates of \\nrestatement than other issuers.\\\\334\\\\ When, in the Proposing Release, we\\n\\n[[Page 17202]]\\n\\nseparately considered issuers with revenues below $100 million, we \\nfound that the accelerated filers in this category are less likely to \\nrestate their financial statements than non-accelerated filers in the \\nsame revenue category.\\\\335\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\333\\\\ The estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of \\nIves Group Audit Analytics data.

Discussion of Economic Effects\\n\\n    The costs and benefits of the amendments, including impacts on \\nefficiency, competition, and capital formation, are discussed below. We \\nfirst address the population and characteristics of issuers that will \\nnewly qualify as non-accelerated filers under the amendments, and then \\nintroduce certain categories of issuers that are used for comparison \\npurposes. We next discuss the anticipated costs and benefits associated \\nwith the proposed change in applicability of the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement. Following this discussion, we consider the \\ncosts and benefits associated with the proposed changes with respect to \\nfiling deadlines, exit thresholds, and other required disclosures. \\nFinally, we consider the relative benefits and costs of the principal \\nreasonable alternatives to the amendments.\\n1. Affected Issuers\\n    We estimate that the amendments will result in 527 additional \\nissuers being classified as non-accelerated filers, and therefore no \\nlonger subject to the filing deadlines and ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement applicable to accelerated filers.\\\\336\\\\ Of these, an \\nestimated 154 issuers are EGCs and are thereby already exempt from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\337\\\\ Among the total 527 affected \\nissuers, an estimated 492 issuers are accelerated filers (or large \\naccelerated filers that have public float of less than $560 million) \\nthat will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers because they \\nhave annual revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to be \\nSRCs.\\\\338\\\\ An additional 28 issuers are BDCs that will be newly \\nclassified as non-accelerated filers because they are currently \\naccelerated filers (and therefore have public float of less than $700 \\nmillion) and have annual investment income of less than $100 \\nmillion.\\\\339\\\\ The remaining seven affected issuers are accelerated \\nfilers that will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers despite \\nhaving revenues of at least $100 million because they have a public \\nfloat of at least $50 million but less than $60 million.\\\\340\\\\ Our \\nestimate of the number of affected issuers excludes issuers for which \\nwe were unable to determine filer classification or revenues, which \\ncould represent up to approximately an additional 30 affected issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\336\\\\ The number of affected issuers is based on staff estimates \\nof: (i) The number of accelerated filers in 2018 that have prior \\nfiscal year revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to \\nbe SRCs (i.e., excluding ABS issuers, RICs, BDCs, subsidiaries of \\nnon-SRCs, and FPIs filing on foreign forms or using IFRS) or are \\nBDCs with prior year investment income of less than $100 million; \\n(ii) the number of large accelerated filers in 2018 that have a \\npublic float of less than $560 million and prior fiscal year \\nrevenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to be SRCs; and \\n(iii) the number of accelerated filers in 2018 that have a public \\nfloat of at least $50 million but less than $60 million. The \\nestimate of the number of affected issuers does not include large \\naccelerated filers that have a public float of at least $560 million \\nbut less than $700 million even though such issuers could become \\nnon-accelerated filers under the amendments if they became eligible \\nto be SRCs under the SRC revenue test in the first year the SRC \\namendments became effective due to the limited horizon of this \\naccommodation. See note 252 above (describing the accommodation \\nprovided in the SRC Adopting Release). Revenue data is sourced from \\nXBRL filings, Compustat, and Calcbench. Public float data is from \\nXBRL. See note 298 above for details on the identification of the \\npopulation of accelerated and large accelerated filers and other \\nfiler types.\\n    \\\\337\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\338\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\339\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\340\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Our estimate of the number of affected issuers does not include any \\nFPIs. We estimate that there are no FPIs that file on domestic forms \\nand present their financial statements pursuant to U.S. GAAP, and that \\nalso meet the required thresholds and other qualifications to be an \\naffected issuer under the amendments. However, there are an estimated \\n31 FPIs that file on foreign forms, but otherwise meet the required \\nthresholds and other qualifications. There are also FPIs filing on \\nforeign forms for which we were unable to determine filer \\nclassification or revenues, which could represent up to approximately \\nan additional 90 FPIs that file on foreign forms but that may meet the \\nrequired thresholds and other qualifications.\\\\341\\\\ While we do not \\ninclude these issuers in our counts of the number of affected \\nissuers,\\\\342\\\\ some of these 30 to 120 additional issuers might choose \\nto file on domestic forms using U.S. GAAP in order to benefit from the \\namendments if these benefits, together with other benefits of such a \\nchoice (such as the ability to rely on the scaled disclosure \\naccommodations available to SRCs) outweigh the costs of changing their \\ndisclosure regime. However, many factors are involved in the choice of \\na reporting regime, and it is difficult to predict how many of these \\nissuers are likely to change their reporting practices due to the \\namendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\341\\\\ The majority of these potential additional issuers are \\nCanadian MJDS filers that are not required to disclose filer type or \\npublic float. See note 298 above.\\n    \\\\342\\\\ In the Proposing Release, note 4 above, we included FPIs \\nthat file on foreign forms, but otherwise meet the required \\nthresholds and other qualifications, in the number of affected \\nissuers. While these issuers could become subject to the amendments \\nby changing their reporting regime, it is difficult to predict how \\nmany would do so and therefore, to be conservative, we do not \\ninclude them in the number of affected issuers in this release.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As noted above, the total number of affected issuers includes an \\nestimated 154 EGCs (including 152 EGCs with annual revenues or, in the \\ncase of BDCs, investment income of less than $100 million and two EGCs \\nthat will be affected because they have a public float of at least $50 \\nmillion but less than $60 million).\\\\343\\\\ It also includes an estimated \\n78 banks with $1 billion or more in total assets that are not \\nEGCs.\\\\344\\\\ The estimated 154 EGCs are not required to comply with the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement under SOX Section 404(b). We \\nestimate that the remaining 373 affected issuers will, including 21 \\nBDCs, be newly exempt from this requirement.\\\\345\\\\ Two commenters \\nprovided estimates of 382 affected issuers and 385 affected issuers, \\nrespectively, as the number of issuers that would be newly exempt from \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement under the proposal.\\\\346\\\\ While \\nthese estimates are largely consistent with our estimate, we note that \\nthe commenters' estimates apply some simplifications and use different \\nunderlying data sources than our estimate.\\\\347\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\343\\\\ See note 336 above.\\n    \\\\344\\\\ Banks are identified as issuers with SIC codes of 6020 \\n(commercial banks), 6021 (national commercial banks), 6022 (state \\ncommercial banks), 6029 (NEC commercial banks), 6035 (savings \\ninstitutions, federally-chartered) or 6036 (savings institutions, \\nnot federally-chartered).\\n    \\\\345\\\\ Of these 373 issuers, 368 had less than $100 million in \\nrevenues (or, in the case of BDCs, investment income) in their last \\nfiscal year, while the remaining five would be affected despite \\nhaving greater revenues because of the revised transition provisions \\n(i.e., because their public float is at least $50 million but less \\nthan $60 million).\\n    \\\\346\\\\ See letters from CFA Inst. and Prof. Barth et al. See also \\nletter from Nasdaq, estimating that at least 399 Nasdaq-listed \\ncompanies may be affected by the amendments.\\n    \\\\347\\\\ For example, neither commenter excludes from its estimate \\nissuers that are not eligible to be SRCs or adjusts for the effect \\nof the revised transition thresholds as described in note 336 above \\nand note 151 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above. The letter from \\nCFA Inst. appears to rely on a footnote in the Proposing Release \\nthat, while citing to the correct definitions of EGC in our rules, \\nincorrectly stated that an EGC is an issuer that has total annual \\ngross revenues of ``less than $1.07 million'' during its most \\nrecently completed fiscal year (rather than the correct threshold of \\n``less than $1.07 billion'') and did not identify the other \\nrequirements to be an EGC (such as not having reached the last day \\nof the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of \\nthe first sale of common equity securities of the issuer under an \\neffective Securities Act registration statement as an EGC). See \\nfootnote 47 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above. The estimate in \\nthe letter from CFA Inst. also excluded all 10-K filers with the SIC \\ncode 6200 (``Security & Commodity Brokers, Dealers, Exchanges & \\nServices''), which we do not believe is appropriate. While the \\nletter correctly indicates that the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement does not apply to audits of brokers and dealers \\nperformed pursuant to SEC Rule 17a-5, these audits apply to the \\nreports required by Rule 17a-5, which are distinct from a Form 10-K \\nfiling. Issuers filing Form 10-Ks that have a subsidiary that is a \\nbroker or dealer are not treated differently from other issuers with \\nrespect to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 17203]]\\n\\n    Of the 373 issuers that will be newly exempt from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement, we estimate that the 78 banks identified above \\nwill be subject to the FDIC auditor attestation requirement,\\\\348\\\\ while \\nthe remaining 295 issuers will not be subject to any such auditor \\nattestation requirement.\\\\349\\\\ For the banks that will be newly exempt \\nfrom the ICFR auditor attestation requirement but will remain subject \\nto the FDIC auditor attestation requirement, the benefits and costs of \\nexpanding the exemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nare both expected to be limited. As discussed in Section IV.B.1. above, \\nthe FDIC auditor attestation requirement is substantively similar to \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement, and is thus expected to \\nrequire similar expenditures and have similar financial reporting \\nbenefits as the ICFR auditor attestation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\348\\\\ If these banks are no longer subject to the SOX Section \\n404(b) auditor attestation requirement, their auditors may follow \\nthe AICPA's auditing standards in lieu of the PCAOB's auditing \\nstandards for the FDIC auditor attestation. See Section 18A of \\nAppendix A to FDIC Rule 363 and the AICPA's AU-C Section 940. See \\nalso Section III.B.1. above.\\n    \\\\349\\\\ Of these 274 issuers, 269 are accelerated filers (or large \\naccelerated filers that have public float of less than $560 million) \\nthat will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers because they \\nhave annual revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to \\nbe SRCs, while the remaining five will be newly classified as non-\\naccelerated filers despite having revenues of at least $100 million \\nbecause they have a public float of at least $50 million but less \\nthan $60 million.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We estimate that approximately 90 percent of the affected issuers \\n(whether including or excluding EGCs) have securities that are listed \\non national exchanges.\\\\350\\\\ The representation in public markets of \\nissuers similar to the affected issuers has decreased relative to the \\nyears before SOX. In particular, over the past two decades, the number \\nof issuers listed on major exchanges has decreased by about 40 \\npercent,\\\\351\\\\ but the decline has been concentrated among smaller size \\nissuers. Specifically, the number of listed issuers with market \\ncapitalization below $700 million has decreased by about 65 \\npercent,\\\\352\\\\ and the number of listed issuers with less than $100 \\nmillion in revenue has decreased by about 60 percent.\\\\353\\\\ One \\ncommenter noted that these statistics do not establish that the costs \\nof the ICFR auditor attestation materially contributed to the decline \\nin listed issuers, and that there are a number of other factors that \\nare likely implicated in the decline of listings.\\\\354\\\\ We cite these \\nstatistics to characterize the affected issuers, not to attribute the \\ndecline in listings to any particular cause. As noted below, the \\namendments could be a positive factor in the decision of additional \\ncompanies to enter public markets, but it may not be the decisive \\nfactor, and the direct impact of the amendments on the number of public \\ncompanies may be limited to the extent that companies may be more \\nfocused on other factors associated with the decision to go \\npublic.\\\\355\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\350\\\\ Staff extracted information regarding whether issuers \\nreported having securities registered under Section 12(b) of the \\nExchange Act from the cover page of annual report filings using a \\ncomputer program supplemented with hand collection.

Potential Benefits of Expanding the Exemption From the ICFR Auditor \\nAttestation Requirement for Affected Issuers\\n    The ICFR auditor attestation requirement has been associated with \\nincreased audit fees and other compliance costs. Exempting the affected \\nissuers from this requirement therefore is likely to have the benefit \\nof reducing compliance costs for these issuers. Given the \\ndisproportionate burden that the fixed component of compliance costs \\nimposes on smaller issuers, as well as the likelihood that many of the \\naffected issuers face financing constraints, these costs savings may \\nenhance capital formation and competition. The discussion below \\nexplores the anticipated cost savings and their potential implications \\nin detail. This discussion is focused on affected issuers that are not \\nexpected to be subject to the FDIC auditor attestation requirement.\\n    We begin by summarizing evidence on the indirect costs and net \\ncosts of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. We then estimate the \\nanticipated effects on audit fees and on other compliance costs of \\nexpanding the exemption from this requirement for the affected issuers, \\nusing reported audit fees, survey data, and existing studies. Finally, \\nwe discuss the implications of the cost savings and other potential \\nbenefits.\\na. Evidence on Possible Indirect Costs of the ICFR Auditor Attestation \\nRequirement\\n    The ICFR auditor attestation requirement may impose costs on \\nissuers and investors beyond the direct costs of compliance. For \\nexample, an increased focus on ICFR as a result of\\n\\n[[Page 17207]]\\n\\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement could have negative effects on \\nissuer performance, if it creates a distraction from operational \\nmatters or reduces investment or risk-taking.\\\\369\\\\ One issuer noted in \\nits comments that its managers' attention was diverted away from its \\noperating performance in its first year complying with the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement, and that, without this requirement, its \\nmanagers' time could have been more productively spent focusing on \\nopportunities to grow the company.\\\\370\\\\ Broader evidence of the \\nindirect costs of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement is \\ninconclusive. Studies have documented a decrease in investment and \\nrisk-taking by U.S. companies compared to companies in other countries \\naround the passage of SOX.\\\\371\\\\ However, others have demonstrated that \\nthese findings are merely the continuation of a trend that began many \\nyears before the passage of SOX \\\\372\\\\ and that they do not appear to be \\ndriven by the applicability of the ICFR auditor attestation or SOX \\nSection 404(a) management ICFR reporting requirements.\\\\373\\\\ Another \\nstudy associates the SOX Section 404 requirements with a decrease in \\npatents and patent citations, but the findings are limited to the early \\nyears of implementation of these requirements and the study is not able \\nto distinguish to what extent the effects are attributable to the SOX \\nSection 404(a) management ICFR reporting requirements versus the SOX \\nSection 404(b) ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\374\\\\ We are unable \\nto quantify the potential indirect cost savings resulting from the \\namendments due to the lack of reliable evidence and data that would \\nallow us to quantitatively identify such effects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\369\\\\ See John Coates & Suraj Srinivasan, SOX after Ten Years: A \\nMultidisciplinary Review, 28(3) Acct.

See Section IV.C.3.d. for further discussion of \\nthis point.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ni. Studies Involving Avoidance Behavior\\n    Some studies have provided evidence that non-accelerated filers may \\nseek to avoid crossing the $75 million public float threshold and \\nbecoming accelerated filers.\\\\376\\\\ Related studies have also found that \\nissuers near or below this threshold are more likely than comparable \\nissuers to take actions that may reduce or avoid an increase in their \\npublic float, such as disclosing more negative news in the second \\nfiscal quarter (when public float is measured), increasing payouts to \\nshareholders, reducing investment in property, plant, equipment, \\nintangibles and acquisitions, and increasing the number of shares held \\nby insiders.\\\\377\\\\ One study uses this avoidance behavior to estimate \\nthe net costs of compliance with the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement for issuers close to the $75 million public float \\nthreshold.\\\\378\\\\ The study concludes that the overall costs, net of any \\nbenefits, of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement for these issuers \\nis roughly $1 million to $2 million per year, but we note that the \\nmethodology used to translate the avoidance behavior into a dollar cost \\nmay be unreliable.\\\\379\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\376\\\\ See, e.g., Peter Iliev, The Effect of SOX Section 404: \\nCosts, Earnings Quality, and Stock Prices, 45 J. of Fin. 1163 (2010) \\n(``Iliev 2010 Study'') (finding that a disproportionate number of \\nissuers had a public float of just under $75 million in 2004, when \\nICFR auditor attestations and management ICFR reports were first \\nrequired for accelerated filers, but not in earlier years); Dhammika \\nDharmapala, Estimating the Compliance Costs of Securities \\nRegulation: A Bunching Analysis of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b), \\nWorking Paper (2016), available at \\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2885849\\n (``Dharmapala 2016 study''); and \\nMcCallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above.\\n    \\\\377\\\\ See F.

This paper estimates a net cost of compliance for \\ncompanies near the threshold of $4 million to $6 million for a few \\nyears of compliance (i.e., $1 million to $2 million per year). The \\nanalysis leading to this estimate relies on the relation between \\npublic float and market capitalization for other companies to \\napproximate the stock market value forgone by those that are \\nestimated to be manipulating their public float downwards. However, \\nwe note that the ratio of market capitalization to public float for \\nother companies may simply reflect their propensity towards having \\naffiliated ownership rather than being a reliable basis with which \\nto measure the cost incurred by manipulating public float.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Avoidance of the $75 million public float threshold would be \\nconsistent with smaller issuers finding the net costs associated with \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement to be significant, though \\nthere could be other reasons for avoiding the threshold. For example, \\nas one commenter argued, such avoidance may reflect managers who would \\nlike to avoid the scrutiny of an audit of ICFR because they are \\nengaging in opportunistic behavior,\\\\380\\\\ although we are unaware of \\ndirect evidence supporting this hypothesis. One commenter, representing \\n48 accounting and law professors, requested that we confirm whether the \\n``bunching'' of companies below the $75 million public float threshold \\nremains present in today's markets.\\\\381\\\\ The commenter noted that such \\nan analysis could help provide confidence that the costs of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement remain as high as previously \\ndocumented.\\\\382\\\\ In response to this comment, our staff conducted \\nsupplemental analysis, presented in Figure 6.\\\\383\\\\ However, as \\ndiscussed below, the conclusions in this Economic Analysis do not rely \\non this analysis.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\380\\\\ See letter from Prof. Barth et al.\\n    \\\\381\\\\ See letter from Prof. Honigsberg et al.\\n    \\\\382\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\383\\\\ The estimates in this figure are based on staff analysis \\nof data from XBRL filings associated with annual reports filed in \\ncalendar year 2018. The figure includes all issuers with an annual \\nreport on Form 10-K, 20-F or 40-F in calendar year 2018 and with \\npublic float data available in XBRL, excluding banks, ABS issuers, \\nand RICs (although we note there were no instances of the latter two \\ntypes of issuers in this sample before these filters were applied). \\nBanks are identified as issuers with SIC codes of 6020 (commercial \\nbanks), 6021 (national commercial banks), 6022 (state commercial \\nbanks), 6029 (NEC commercial banks), 6035 (savings institutions, \\nfederally-chartered) or 6036 (savings institutions, not federally-\\nchartered).\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 17208]]\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MR20.005\\n\\n    Figure 6 presents the distribution of public float across issuers \\nother than banks, ABS issuers, and RICs. We exclude ABS issuers and \\nRICs because they are unlikely to be sensitive to the public float \\nthreshold as they would not be subject to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement (or able to avail themselves of the disclosure \\naccommodations for SRCs) regardless of their public float. We exclude \\nbanks because they may be subject to the FDIC auditor attestation \\nrequirement, which, as discussed above, is comparable to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement, regardless of their public float. \\nWhile EGCs would not be subject to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement regardless of their public float, we nevertheless include \\nthem in Figure 6 because it is a temporary exemption and such issuers \\nmay already consider the implications of their public float in advance \\nof graduating from this status. However, we obtain similar results when \\nwe include or exclude any of these categories of issuers.\\n    The pattern in Figure 6 demonstrates that there may be some \\n``bunching'' of public floats below the $75 million threshold in 2018. \\nThe pattern is similar to that presented in two recent studies that \\nfind a discontinuity in public float at the $75 million threshold when \\nconsidering data across the 12 or 13 year period ending in 2015.\\\\384\\\\ \\nOur findings for 2018 also are consistent with a year-by-year analysis \\nin one of these studies that suggests that this behavior does not \\nappear to change significantly over the time period studied.\\\\385\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\384\\\\ See McCallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above, and \\nDharmapala 2016 study, note 376 above.\\n    \\\\385\\\\ See McCallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Our findings are less consistent with another analysis of public \\nfloat, which failed to find evidence of ``bunching'' in 2017.\\\\386\\\\ This \\nanalysis was cited in a submission to the comment file.\\\\387\\\\ When we \\nexamine the data underlying this analysis,\\\\388\\\\ we find that, although \\nwe obtain public float data from different sources,\\\\389\\\\ our public \\nfloat values are over 90 percent correlated with those used in tthis \\nanalysis. We note, however, that the analysis applies sample selection \\nfilters that exclude, among other issuers, issuers that would become \\nnewly subject to an ICFR auditor attestation requirement (and, during \\nthis time period, lose the disclosure accommodations for SRCs) upon \\ncrossing the $75 million public float threshold. The exclusions result \\nin a sample size that is approximately half as large as that in our \\nanalysis.\\\\390\\\\ For\\n\\n[[Page 17209]]\\n\\nexample, we understand that the other analysis excludes all financial \\ninstitutions and issuers with a market capitalization of greater than \\n$150 million.\\\\391\\\\ This difference, we find, accounts for the bulk of \\nthe difference in our figures. Thus, our analysis reflects a \\nsignificantly larger and more representative sample of issuers and may \\ntherefore be more reliable.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\386\\\\ See Commissioner Jackson's Statement. While we provide \\nresults for 2018 in Figure 6 in order to present the most recent and \\nreliable available data, we obtain very similar results when running \\nthe same analysis for 2017.\\n    \\\\387\\\\ See letter from Prof. Barth et al., citing an analysis in \\nCommissioner Jackson's Statement that finds no evidence of bunching \\nin 2017.\\n    \\\\388\\\\ See ``Public Float Data (2017)'' available at \\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/jackson-statement-proposed-amendments-accelerated-filer-definition\\n.\\n    \\\\389\\\\ The data underlying the analysis cited by a commenter is \\ngenerated by using a computer program to extract text from annual \\nreports, applying computer algorithms and filters to isolate public \\nfloat numbers, and then manually checking the results. See \\nCommissioner Jackson's Statement. The data underlying our analysis \\nis based on XBRL filings.\\n    \\\\390\\\\ The figure in the other analysis reflects 388 issuers, \\ncompared to 731, or almost twice as many issuers, in our analysis.\\n    \\\\391\\\\ Financial institutions are issuers with SIC codes between \\n6000 and 6999 and include issuers that are not banks. Other filters \\napplied in that analysis include requiring that market \\ncapitalization data be available and that the reported public float \\nbe at least 10%, but no more than three times, the market \\ncapitalization.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As discussed above, if issuers seek to avoid crossing the $75 \\nmillion public float threshold, such behavior could reflect a high net \\ncost of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement but could also reflect \\na self-serving desire to avoid scrutiny. Any such behavior could also \\nbe influenced by other requirements associated with this public float \\nthreshold during this time period, such as the loss of scaled \\ndisclosure accommodations available to SRCs.\\\\392\\\\ Thus, though we have \\nconsidered the studies, evidence, and comments received regarding this \\navoidance behavior, the conclusions in this Economic Analysis do not \\nrely on these findings.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\392\\\\ The analysis presented in Figure 6 is based on annual \\nreports filed in calendar year 2018, which generally pertain to 2017 \\nfiscal years. The amendments to the SRC definition were effective on \\nSeptember 10, 2018. See SRC Adopting Release, note 12 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nii. Studies Based on Comparative Analysis or Market Reactions\\n    We have also considered studies that have used other methodologies \\nto attempt to quantify the net costs or benefits of the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement. One study attempts to quantify and compare \\ncertain costs and benefits of exempting non-accelerated filers from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement, focusing on those costs and \\nbenefits that the study deems to be measurable, and finds that the cost \\nsavings associated with exempting these issuers (an estimated $388 \\nmillion in aggregate audit fee savings) have been less than the lost \\nbenefits (e.g., an aggregate $719 million in lower earnings) in \\naggregate present value terms.\\\\393\\\\ Studies have also used stock market \\nreactions to changes in the applicability of the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement to estimate its net costs or benefits, because \\nthe stock market valuation should incorporate both expected costs and \\nexpected benefits from a shareholder's perspective. We focus on studies \\nthat consider events that allow the effects of the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement to be isolated from those of the other \\nrequirements that were imposed by SOX, as many early studies did not \\nisolate the effects of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement from \\nother changes required by the same legislation, such as the audit \\ncommittee requirements of SOX Section 301 \\\\394\\\\ and the certifications \\nrequired pursuant to SOX Section 302. Regardless, the results of the \\nstudies we focus on have been mixed, perhaps due in part to changes \\nover time in how the ICFR auditor attestation requirement has been \\nimplemented. For example, a study analyzing the response to \\nannouncements of initial delays in the application of the requirements \\nto some issuers in order to identify the stock market reaction \\nassociated with the ICFR auditor attestation requirement found that \\nthis requirement was associated with a net reduction in stock market \\nvaluation for foreign issuers.\\\\395\\\\ On the other hand, a study of the \\nresponse to the later permanent exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement for some issuers found that this requirement \\nwas associated with a net increase in stock market valuation for \\nsmaller issuers.\\\\396\\\\ The latter finding is consistent with studies \\nthat conclude that the requirement is value-enhancing based on a \\nnegative stock market reaction to issuers excluding acquired operations \\nfrom management's assessment of ICFR and the ICFR auditor attestation, \\nthough these studies do not determine the extent to which this effect \\nis attributable to the ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\397\\\\ Similarly, a \\nstudy of smaller issuers that switched regimes over time found that \\nbeing subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement was \\nassociated with an increase in stock market valuation for these \\nissuers.\\\\398\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\393\\\\ We note that the estimates in this study rely on a number \\nof critical assumptions and estimations. See Weili Ge, Allison \\nKoester, & Sarah McVay, Benefits and Costs of Sarbanes-Oxley Section \\n404(b) Exemption: Evidence from Small Firms' Internal Control \\nDisclosures, 63 J. of Acct. and Econ. 358 (2017) (``Ge et al. 2017 \\nStudy'') (estimating the effect on audit fees by comparing the audit \\nfees of non-accelerated filers to those of accelerated filers with \\nmarket capitalization of $300 million or less; and estimating the \\neffect on earnings by estimating the percentage of non-accelerated \\nfilers that may newly disclose ineffective ICFR upon entering an \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement, based on changes in the rate \\nof disclosure of ineffective ICFR by issuers that transition into \\naccelerated filer status, and applying to this estimate a further \\nestimate of the difference in return on assets that could be \\nassociated with such disclosure and any related remediation, based \\non the results of a multivariate regression relating issuers' change \\nin return on assets to a number of factors, including whether or not \\nthey disclosed and remediated ineffective ICFR).

Potential Reduction in Audit Fees\\n    While issuers disclose their total audit fees, they are not \\nrequired to disclose the portion of these fees that is attributable to \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement.

One recent study focusing on low public float \\nissuers separately considered the subset of issuers with less than $100 \\nmillion in revenues in their sample and estimated that an exemption \\nfrom the ICFR auditor attestation requirement would result in an audit \\nfee savings of $135,000 per year for these issuers.\\\\411\\\\ While this \\nanalysis was focused on lower float issuers, it is generally supportive \\nof the order of magnitude of our estimate. One commenter questioned \\nwhether our estimate considers the incremental costs associated with an \\naudit approach that does not have the benefit of a related audit of \\nICFR.\\\\412\\\\ We note that our analysis is intended to capture this \\neffect, as the issuers in the comparison samples which we use to derive \\nour estimate generally require this type of an audit approach because \\nthey are not subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\409\\\\ See, e.g., letters from EY, Grant Thornton, and RSM.\\n    \\\\410\\\\ See Section III.C.3.b. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n    \\\\411\\\\ See McCallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above.\\n    \\\\412\\\\ See letter from BDO.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We therefore maintain, without change, our estimate of $110,000 in \\naverage audit fee savings per year per affected issuer that would be \\nnewly exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. As noted in \\nthe Proposing Release, the audit fee savings are expected to vary \\nacross the affected issuers, with some experiencing smaller savings and \\nsome experiencing much larger savings depending on their individual \\ncircumstances. In line with this expectation, several commenters \\ninsisted that any reductions in audit fees resulting from the \\namendments would depend on facts and circumstances and vary widely \\namong issuers.\\\\413\\\\ Consistent with these costs savings being highly \\nvaried, a number of commenters to the Proposing Release provided \\nestimates of costs that specific issuers had incurred or expected to \\nsave ranging from $40,000 per year to costs of over $2 million dollars, \\nthough most of these estimates include costs other than audit fees \\n(which are discussed below), some include one-time start-up costs as \\nwell as ongoing annual costs, and the largest estimate includes costs \\nattributable to SOX Section 404(a) and\\n\\n[[Page 17211]]\\n\\nother SOX requirements.\\\\414\\\\ Similarly, a few of the commenters to the \\nSRC Proposing Release cited costs of $400,000 to over $1 million \\nassociated with the ICFR auditor attestation requirement (though it is \\npossible that these estimates also include costs other than audit \\nfees).\\\\415\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\413\\\\ See, e.g., letters from EY, Grant Thornton, and PWC.\\n    \\\\414\\\\ See letters from Cerecor (estimating a total of $1 million \\nin expected savings for 2020 associated with an exemption from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement), Concert (estimating expected \\naudit fees associated with the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nto represent approximately 45 percent of its total audit fees), \\nGuaranty (estimating future annual costs of $40,000 in personnel and \\nexternal audit costs associated with ongoing compliance with the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement, as well as a higher estimate \\nof costs expended for their first year of compliance in 2018 of \\n$167,745 in audit fees as well as $72,000 and 2,340 labor hours \\nexpended across the issuer's accounting, information technology and \\nrisk management offices), Pieris (estimating that their first year \\nof compliance with the ICFR auditor attestation requirement would be \\nassociated with a total of $1.5 million in costs), Syros (estimating \\nthat its expected additional costs for compliance with the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement would range from $250,000 to \\n$400,000 per year, including incremental external auditor fees, \\nconsultant fees, and an increased burden on employee resources), and \\nTerra Tech (estimating over $2 million in costs expended in 2018 for \\nmeeting all of its SOX compliance requirements, including but not \\nlimited to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, representing \\ncosts to build a new information technology infrastructure, to hire \\nnew staff and consultants, and to pay auditing fees).\\n    \\\\415\\\\ See note 208 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    One commenter noted that the requirement to implement scaled, risk-\\nbased audits of ICFR should already result in an appropriately reduced \\ncost of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement for many affected \\nissuers.\\\\416\\\\ We note that our quantitative methodology is intended to \\nreflect the current cost of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, \\nincluding the benefits of scaling. Also, while the adoption of AS 2201 \\nin 2007, which facilitated the scaling of audits of ICFR, was found to \\nhave initially led to lower audit fees, there is evidence that these \\ncosts began to increase again around the year 2010.\\\\417\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\416\\\\ See letter from CFA.\\n    \\\\417\\\\ See Section IV.B.1. above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Finally, we note that some issuers may voluntarily choose to \\ncontinue to make these expenditures if they deem the benefits of the \\nICFR auditor attestation to exceed the cost, and that the extent of \\nsavings may be affected if auditors continue to test the operating \\neffectiveness of some controls as part of their financial statement \\naudit. In such cases, the audit fee savings may be reduced, but we \\nwould expect the potential costs of expanding the exemption from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement to be correspondingly lower as \\nwell.\\nd. Additional Potential Compliance Cost Savings\\n    The ICFR auditor attestation requirement is associated with other \\ncompliance costs beyond audit fees, including outside vendor costs and \\ninternal labor costs.\\\\418\\\\ However, these costs are difficult to \\nmeasure because they are not required to be reported. Practitioner \\nstudies based on surveys of issuers often report non-audit costs of the \\ninternal control assessment and reporting requirements of SOX Section \\n404 in particular or of SOX in general, but the costs attributable to \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement versus the SOX Section 404(a) \\nmanagement ICFR reporting requirements or other requirements are \\ngenerally not broken out separately.\\\\419\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\418\\\\ See, e.g., Leuz and Wysocki 2016 Study, note 396 above.\\n    \\\\419\\\\ See, e.g., Protiviti 2018 Report, note 317 above (finding, \\nfor example, total internal costs associated with all aspects of SOX \\ncompliance to be $282,900 for 2018 for respondents with less than \\n$100 million in revenues) and SOX & Internal Controls Professionals \\nGroup, Moss Adams LLP, and Workiva (2017), ``2017 State of the SOX/\\nInternal Controls Market Survey'' (``2017 SICPG Survey Report''), \\navailable at \\nwww.mossadams.com/landingpages/2017-sox-and-internal-controls-market-survey\\n.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Proposing Release presented an analysis of data from the 2008-\\n09 Survey on the non-audit costs of SOX Section 404 in general, such as \\noutside vendor costs, labor, and non-labor costs (such as software, \\nhardware and travel costs), as well as the percentage of the outside \\nvendor costs and labor hours that were attributable to the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement. Based on this analysis, we estimated that the \\naverage non-audit costs attributable to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement at the time of the survey were approximately $125,000 per \\nyear.\\\\420\\\\ Adjusting this historical cost downward slightly to account \\nfor the fact that some of these expenditures may now be required even \\nin the case of a financial statement only audit (due to the risk \\nassessment auditing standards issued subsequent to this survey), we \\nestimated that the average non-audit costs attributable to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement are currently approximately $100,000 \\nper year.\\\\421\\\\ As noted in the Proposing Release, this estimate is \\nsubject to uncertainty because it is unclear exactly how the current \\ncosts may differ from the survey responses a decade ago, and the costs \\nmay be different for low-revenue issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\420\\\\ See Section III.C.3.c. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n    \\\\421\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Commenters did not provide alternative methodologies for obtaining \\nan estimate of the average non audit-fee savings. One recent study \\nfocusing on low public float issuers considered the potential effect of \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement on selling, general and \\nadministrative (``SG&A'') expenses other than audit fees, and concluded \\nthat there was an association with an increase in these internal costs, \\nbut was unable to reliably estimate the magnitude of this effect.\\\\422\\\\ \\nWe therefore maintain, without change, our estimate of $100,000 in \\naverage non-audit compliance cost savings per year per affected issuer \\nthat would be newly exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\422\\\\ See McCallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As in the case of audit fees, some of the affected issuers are \\nexpected to experience lower cost savings while others would experience \\ngreater savings, depending on their individual circumstances. For \\nexample, we noted in the Proposing Release that some issuers had \\nreported potential cost savings other than audit fees ranging from \\nabout $110,000 to about $350,000.\\\\423\\\\ While commenters to the \\nProposing Release generally did not separately break out these non-\\naudit costs, they reported total costs including audit fees but also \\ninternal labor and consultant costs ranging from $40,000 to over $2 \\nmillion, though, as noted above, some include one-time start-up costs \\nas well as ongoing annual costs, and the largest estimate includes \\ncosts attributable to SOX Section 404(a) and other SOX \\nrequirements.\\\\424\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\423\\\\ See note 211 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above.\\n    \\\\424\\\\ See letters from Cerecor, Guaranty, Pieris, Syros, and \\nTerra Tech, as discussed in more detail in above note 414.

Implications of the Cost Savings\\n    While we estimate the average compliance cost associated with the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement for the affected issuers, it is \\nmore difficult to discern whether incurring the costs of this \\nrequirement represents the most effective use of funds for these \\nissuers. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.c. below, issuers for whom the \\nrequirement is eliminated may determine that it is worthwhile to use \\nthese funds to voluntarily undergo an audit of ICFR.\\\\425\\\\ \\nAlternatively, some of these issuers could directly invest the \\ncompliance cost savings in improving their\\n\\n[[Page 17212]]\\n\\noperations and prospects for growth, or in their control systems.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\425\\\\ See letter from BIO (supporting allowing ``issuers and \\ntheir investors the flexibility to determine for themselves whether \\nSection 404(b) is relevant to their business'').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In total, we estimate an average cost savings of $210,000 per \\nissuer per year, with some of the affected issuers experiencing lesser \\nor greater savings.\\\\426\\\\ While a few commenters noted that ICFR auditor \\nattestations have become less expensive over time \\\\427\\\\ or that they \\nshould already be less expensive for the affected issuers due to the \\nability to scale the audit of ICFR,\\\\428\\\\ we note that our analysis, \\nusing only recent years of data and low-revenue issuers, is intended to \\ncapture any such effects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\426\\\\ As noted above, this estimate is not intended to apply to \\naffected issuers that would not otherwise be subject to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement (i.e., EGCs) or that would remain \\nsubject to the FDIC auditor attestation requirement (i.e., banks \\nwith assets of over $1 billion).\\n    \\\\427\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst. and Deloitte.\\n    \\\\428\\\\ See letter from CFA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters argued that these cost savings are economically \\nsmall.\\\\429\\\\ In particular, they estimated that the savings represent \\n0.5 percent of the average affected issuer's revenue and 0.1 percent of \\nits market value.\\\\430\\\\ Similarly, many commenters asserted that the \\nproposed amendments would not enhance capital formation--and some \\nindicated they could even reduce capital formation.\\\\431\\\\ Others noted \\nthat, in general, the costs of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nare substantial,\\\\432\\\\ and that by eliminating the requirement for \\ncertain issuers, the proposed amendments would enhance capital \\nformation or allow those issuers to preserve capital.\\\\433\\\\ We continue \\nto believe that the average expected savings is likely, in many cases, \\nto represent a meaningful cost savings for issuers with less than $100 \\nmillion in revenue and may thus have beneficial economic effects on \\ncompetition and capital formation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\429\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., CII, and Prof. \\nBarth et al.\\n    \\\\430\\\\ We obtain similar estimates. Specifically, we estimate \\nthat the annual savings represents of 0.7 percent of the median \\nrevenue and 0.1 percent of the median market capitalization of the \\naffected issuers that would be newly exempt from all ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirements. We note, however, that 12 percent of these \\nissuers have zero revenues, and that the savings are estimated for a \\nsingle year while market capitalization incorporates expectations \\nregarding all future years of performance.\\n    \\\\431\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CII, CFA, and \\nProf. Ge et al. See also CFA Inst. (stating that the Proposing \\nRelease, note 4 above, does not demonstrate that eliminating the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement would enhance capital \\nformation).\\n    \\\\432\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BIO, Broadmark, Carver, Guaranty, \\nICBA, MSB, SSB, and Syros.\\n    \\\\433\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Andersen, CLSA, Concert, ICBA, and \\nNASBA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In particular, while the average annual cost savings may represent \\na small percentage of the average affected issuers' revenues and market \\ncapitalizations, it is significant relative to the income and cash \\nflows of these issuers. As noted in the Proposing Release, low-revenue \\nissuers are likely to face financing constraints because they do not \\nhave access to internally-generated capital.\\\\434\\\\ A majority of the \\naffected issuers that will be newly exempt from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement, and that will not be subject to the FDIC \\nauditor attestation requirement, have negative net income and negative \\nnet cash flows from operations.\\\\435\\\\ In the absence of significant \\nincome generation, the average savings of $210,000 per year may be \\nlikely to be put to productive use,\\\\436\\\\ such as towards capital \\ninvestments, which would enhance capital formation. A number of issuers \\ncommented that they anticipated that the savings would allow for \\nincreased investment in their core business.\\\\437\\\\ Also, while some \\nissuers may experience lesser savings, some commented that they expect \\nto experience substantially greater savings,\\\\438\\\\ so the cost savings \\nare likely to be significant for some, even if not all, of the affected \\nissuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\434\\\\ For example, the Proposing Release, note 4 above, cited \\none commenter that indicated that ``pre-revenue small businesses \\nutilize only investment dollars to fund their work'' and that any \\ncost savings thus ``could lead to funding for a new life-saving \\nmedicine.'' See note 213 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above.\\n    \\\\435\\\\ See note 362 above.\\n    \\\\436\\\\ For example, in a survey of issuers in the biotech \\nindustry, among 11 biotech EGCs that responded to a question \\nregarding how an extension of the exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement would affect them given the costs associated \\nwith the requirement, eight out of the 11 issuers indicated that \\nthey expected a positive impact on investments in research and \\ndevelopment and six out of the 11 issuers indicated that they \\nexpected a positive impact on hiring employees. See BIO Study, note \\n69 above.\\n    \\\\437\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Cerecor, Concert, Guaranty, Pieris \\nand Syros.\\n    \\\\438\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Cerecor, Corvus, and Terratech, \\nestimating savings of $1 to $2 million.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Further, several commenters cited fixed costs of compliance that do \\nnot scale with size.\\\\439\\\\ Because of the fixed costs component of \\ncompliance costs, smaller issuers generally bear proportionately higher \\ncompliance costs than larger issuers.\\\\440\\\\ To illustrate this \\ndisparity, we estimated in the Proposing Release that total audit fees \\nrepresent about 22 percent of revenues on average for accelerated \\nfilers with less than $100 million in revenues, versus 0.5 percent of \\nrevenue for those above $100 million in revenues.\\\\441\\\\ Reducing the \\naffected issuers' costs would reduce their overhead expenses and may \\nenhance their ability to compete with larger issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\439\\\\ See letters from ASA, Broadmark, Chamber, and Guaranty.\\n    \\\\440\\\\ While it is difficult to identify the specific source of \\nthe fixed component of compliance costs, there is empirical evidence \\nof such fixed costs based on differences in the ratio of such costs \\nto measures of issuer size across issuer size categories. For \\nexample, the ratio of the costs for accelerated filers of complying \\nwith Section 404 to the book value of the issuer's assets decreases \\nwith issuer size. See, e.g., Figure 1 of Alexander et al. 2013 \\nStudy, note 401 above. There is evidence of some such fixed costs \\npersisting even after the 2007 change in the ICFR auditing standard \\nfacilitating the scaling of an audit of ICFR, as demonstrated by the \\nresults in the cited figure for issuers that had been complying with \\nSection 404(b) for five years (as observations in the figure \\npertaining to lesser years of experience may include costs \\nexperienced by some issuers in years prior to the 2007 changes).\\n    \\\\441\\\\ See Section III.C.2.d. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The alleviation of these costs could be a positive factor in the \\ndecision of additional companies to enter public markets.\\\\442\\\\ That is, \\nif future compliance costs associated with ICFR auditor attestations \\nweigh against these companies becoming publicly traded, reducing these \\nexpected future costs may enhance capital formation in the public \\nmarkets and the efficient allocation of capital at the market level. As \\nnoted above, the expected compliance cost savings are likely to vary \\nacross issuers. The amendments may be most likely to influence the \\ndecision to enter the public markets for companies that anticipate \\nparticularly high costs to obtain an ICFR auditor attestation and that \\nexpect low levels of revenue to persist for many years into the future.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\442\\\\ See, e.g., letter from ICBA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Some commenters suggested that the amendments would encourage \\ncompanies to enter the public markets.\\\\443\\\\ On the other hand, other \\ncommenters maintained that the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\ndoes not prevent companies from entering the public markets.\\\\444\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\443\\\\ See, e.g., letters from AdvaMed, AdvaMed et al., \\nBroadmark, Cerecor, and ICBA.\\n    \\\\444\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., CII, and Crowe.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Research investigating the link between SOX and companies exiting \\nor choosing not to enter public markets has been inconclusive.\\\\445\\\\ We \\nagree with commenters who stated that a number of other factors have \\nbeen associated\\n\\n[[Page 17213]]\\n\\nwith the decline in listings.\\\\446\\\\ Further, newly public issuers can \\nalready avail themselves of an exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement for at least one and generally up to five years \\nafter their IPO.\\\\447\\\\ While the amendments could be a positive factor \\nin the decision of additional companies to enter public markets, it may \\nnot be the decisive factor, and the direct impact of the amendments on \\nthe number of publicly traded companies may be limited to the extent \\nthat companies may be more focused on other factors associated with the \\ndecision to go public.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\445\\\\ There is some evidence of a decreased rate of IPOs and an \\nincreased rate of going private transactions and deregistrations in \\nthe United States after SOX. However, it is unclear to what extent \\nthese changes can be attributed to SOX (or to the auditor \\nattestation requirement in particular) versus other factors, and to \\nwhat extent these changes are a cause for concern. See e.g., Coates \\nand Srinivasan 2014 Study, note 369 above, at 636-640 (summarizing a \\nnumber of studies in this area).\\n    \\\\446\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., CII, and Crowe. \\nOther factors commenters cited include the expansion of exemptions \\nto registration that increase companies' ability to raise funds \\nprivately, see, e.g., letters from CFA, CII, and Crowe; corporate \\nconsolidations, see, e.g., letters from CFA and CII; market \\nconditions, see letter from CFA; and the general regulatory \\nenvironment, see letter from Crowe.\\n    \\\\447\\\\ See note 11 above regarding the exemption of EGCs from the \\nauditor attestation requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n3. Potential Costs of Expanding the Exemption From the ICFR Auditor \\nAttestation Requirement for Affected Issuers\\n    Exempting the affected issuers from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement may result, over time, in management at this category of \\nissuers being less likely to maintain effective ICFR, which in turn may \\nresult in less reliable financial statements, on average, for these \\nissuers. The discussion below explores this potential effect and its \\nimplications in detail. We also consider two mitigating factors that \\ncould be associated with the affected issuers on average, though we \\nacknowledge that they may not apply equally to all of the affected \\nissuers. First, low-revenue issuers may, on average, be less \\nsusceptible to the risk of certain kinds of misstatements, such as \\nerrors associated with revenue recognition.\\\\448\\\\ Second, in many cases, \\nthe market value of such issuers may be driven to a greater degree by \\ntheir future prospects than by the current period's financial \\nstatements, which may affect how, on average, investors use these \\nissuers' financial statements. This discussion is focused on affected \\nissuers that will be newly exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement and will not be subject to the FDIC auditor attestation \\nrequirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\448\\\\ See BIO Study, note 69 above (finding that biotechnology \\nEGCs have lower restatement frequencies than other issuers, after \\ncontrolling for other factors, and attributing this to their \\n``absence of product revenue'' based on findings that revenue \\nrecognition is one of the most frequent drivers of financial \\nrestatements).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Exempting the affected issuers from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement could also increase the risk that material weaknesses in \\nICFR may not be detected and disclosed, and thereby reduce the \\ninformation available to investors for gauging the reliability of these \\nissuers' financial statements. In this regard, we also discuss below \\nthe potential effects related to the identification and disclosure of \\nmaterial weaknesses in ICFR at the affected issuers. However, given the \\nsize of the estimated effect as well as recent findings discussed in \\nSection IV.C.3.a. below on how ICFR auditor attestations may provide \\nlimited information about the risk of future restatements,\\\\449\\\\ we \\nbelieve that any such effect would not significantly affect investors' \\noverall ability to make informed investment decisions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\449\\\\ See notes 453 through 459 below and accompanying text.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\na. Broad Considerations and Evidence Regarding the Effects of ICFR \\nAuditor Attestations on Financial Reporting\\n    This section summarizes a number of broad economic considerations \\nrelated to the possible effects of an ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement on financial reporting in order to provide context for the \\nmore detailed analysis of the costs of exempting the affected parties \\nfrom this requirement that follows. As discussed below, the anticipated \\neffects of changes to the population of issuers subject to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement will depend on the characteristics of \\nthe specific group of issuers that will be affected. In this regard we \\nnote that prior research has not focused on the effects of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement on low-revenue issuers in particular. \\nAs discussed in Section IV.B.1., there also have been significant \\nchanges over time in the implementation of the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement, the standards applying to a financial statement audit even \\nin the absence of an audit of ICFR, and the execution of audits of \\nfinancial statements and of ICFR, which may have had the effect of \\nreducing both the incremental costs and incremental benefits of an ICFR \\nauditor attestation since the periods studied in much of the existing \\nresearch. We therefore acknowledge that, while we believe that \\nconsideration of the past research is an important part of our \\nanalysis, these factors limit our ability to rely on the findings of \\npast research to predict how the amendments would affect the particular \\nclass of issuers implicated by this rulemaking.\\n    ICFR auditor attestations can have two primary types of benefits. \\nFirst, the ICFR auditor attestation reports can provide incremental \\ninformation to investors about the reliability of the financial \\nstatements. Second, the reliability of the financial statements can be \\nenhanced. That is, the expectation of, or process involved in, the ICFR \\nauditor attestation could lead issuers to maintain better controls, \\nwhich could lead to more reliable financial reporting. Importantly for \\nour evaluation of these possible benefits, however, we do not directly \\nobserve the effectiveness of ICFR and the reliability of financial \\nstatements, but only the associated disclosures by issuers. For \\nexample, while restatements may indicate that controls have failed, \\nsuch restatements are often predicated on the underlying misstatements \\nbeing detected. Given such limitations with the available data, the \\nanalysis in existing studies and in this release is necessarily less \\nthan definitive.\\n    Regarding the first possible benefit of ICFR auditor attestations, \\nacademic research provides some evidence that ICFR auditor attestation \\nreports contain information about the reliability of financial \\nstatements, but also demonstrates that the incremental information \\nprovided by these reports may be limited. The 2011 SEC Staff Study \\nsummarizes evidence that ICFR auditor attestations generally resulted \\nin the identification and disclosure of material weaknesses that were \\nnot previously identified or whose severity was misclassified when \\nidentified by management in its assessment of ICFR, and that investor \\nrisk assessments and investment decisions were associated with the \\nfindings in auditor attestation reports.\\\\450\\\\ As noted by a \\ncommenter,\\\\451\\\\ various survey results are also supportive of these \\nreports being informative to investors.\\\\452\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\450\\\\ See 2011 SEC Staff Study, note 198 above, at 97-99 and \\n102-104. See also Coates and Srinivasan 2014 Study, note 369 above.\\n    \\\\451\\\\ See letter from CII.\\n    \\\\452\\\\ See Lawrence Brown, Andrew Call, Michael Clement, and \\nNathan Sharp, The Activities of Buy-Side Analysts and the \\nDeterminants of their Stock Recommendations, 62 J. of Acct. and \\nEcon. 139 (2016) (finding, in a survey of buy-side analysts, that 60 \\npercent responded that material weaknesses in ICFR are definitely a \\nred flag of management potentially misrepresenting financial \\nresults, and that the existence of a material weakness in ICFR was \\nthe most cited red flag for misrepresentation followed by weak \\ncorporate governance; however, this survey did not differentiate \\nbetween firms subject or not subject to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    However, more recent studies have found that auditor identification \\nof material weaknesses in ICFR tends to be concurrent with the \\ndisclosure of restatements, rather than providing advance warning of \\nthe potential for\\n\\n[[Page 17214]]\\n\\nrestatements.\\\\453\\\\ While these findings do not imply that ICFR auditor \\nattestation reports fail to provide any useful information about the \\nrisk of future restatements,\\\\454\\\\ they demonstrate that this \\ninformation may be limited. Further, researchers have been able to \\npredict the identification by auditors of material weaknesses in ICFR \\nbeyond those identified by management, to some extent, by using \\notherwise available information about issuers beyond current \\nrestatements, such as their institutional ownership, aggregate losses, \\npast restatements, and late filings.\\\\455\\\\ One commenter notes that this \\npredictability does not imply that there is limited incremental \\ninformation provided by ICFR auditor attestation reports, as their \\nanalysis suggests that investors are not able to fully discern \\nmisreporting by issuers about their ICFR.\\\\456\\\\ Still, we believe that \\nthe evidence suggests that markets at least partially, though perhaps \\nnot fully, incorporate this information even in the absence of an ICFR \\nauditor attestation.\\\\457\\\\ Limitations to the incremental information \\nprovided by ICFR auditor attestation reports about the risk of future \\nrestatements may result from disincentives, such as the increased risk \\nof litigation and greater likelihood of management and auditor turnover \\nthat have been associated with earlier material weakness disclosures, \\nfor issuers and their auditors to disclose material weaknesses in the \\nabsence of restatements.\\\\458\\\\ It may also result from issues with the \\nquality of the audit of ICFR. In this regard, researchers have found \\nthat PCAOB scrutiny of these audits has been associated with a slightly \\nhigher rate of identification of material weaknesses in ICFR prior to a \\nlater restatement.\\\\459\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\453\\\\ See, e.g., Sarah Rice & David Weber, How Effective is \\nInternal Control Reporting under SOX 404?

We note that \\nauditors have a duty to follow auditing standards and, if they do \\nnot, face associated enforcement, inspection, reputation, and \\nlitigation risks that provide a countervailing incentive.\\n    \\\\459\\\\ See, e.g., Defond and Lennox 2017 Study, note 307 above \\n(finding that PCAOB inspections may increase auditors' issuance of \\nadverse internal control opinions to clients with later \\nrestatements; in particular, the study documents that in 2010, 96 \\npercent of financial statements that were later restated were \\naccompanied by ICFR auditor attestations disclosing no material \\nweaknesses in ICFR, while this rate dropped to 91 percent by 2013).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    A further reason why ICFR auditor attestation reports may provide \\nonly a weak warning about future restatements is that the audit of ICFR \\nmay contribute to the avoidance of misstatements, leading us to observe \\nonly the residual restatements where the misstatement risk was not \\nforeseen or a misstatement was not detected for reasons unrelated to \\ninternal controls. Thus, the second possible benefit we consider is \\nthat the audit of ICFR may encourage management to maintain more \\neffective controls and thereby deter accounting errors and fraud. The \\nacademic research discussed below documents substantial evidence that \\nwould be consistent with such effects, though, as is common in \\nfinancial economics, it is difficult to determine whether the \\ndocumented differences can be causally linked to the audit of \\nICFR.\\\\460\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\460\\\\ See Coates and Srinivasan 2014 Study, note 369 above, and \\nLeuz and Wysocki 2016 Study, note 396 above (both articles \\ndiscussing the limited ability to make causal attribution based on \\nresearch on the effects of the provisions of SOX, but also \\nhighlighting the specific studies that can more plausibly make \\ncausal claims).

The 2011 SEC \\nStaff Study provides analysis and summarizes research indicating that \\nissuers that were not required to obtain an ICFR auditor attestation \\ndisclosed ineffective ICFR at a greater rate than those that were \\nsubject to such requirements,\\\\462\\\\ and newer studies demonstrate that \\nthis difference has remained consistent in recent years.\\\\463\\\\ Further, \\na recent paper finds that the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, but \\nnot management ICFR reporting requirements alone, are associated with \\nenhanced quarterly earnings accrual quality, and argues that this is an \\nindication of the improved quality of internal controls.\\\\464\\\\ We note, \\nhowever, that this study finds that the improvements for issuers \\nsubject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement are attenuated \\nafter the 2007 change in the ICFR auditing standard discussed in \\nSection IV.B.1. above.\\\\465\\\\ The ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nhas also been associated with a higher rate of remediation of material \\nweaknesses after they are disclosed.\\\\466\\\\ As noted by\\n\\n[[Page 17215]]\\n\\na commenter,\\\\467\\\\ survey evidence is also consistent with this \\nrequirement being associated with more effective ICFR. For example, \\nthis commenter cites a recent survey of public companies that found \\nthat 57 percent responded that one of the primary benefits of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement was ``improved internal control over \\nfinancial reporting (ICFR) structure.'' \\\\468\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\461\\\\ See Section IV.B.1. above.\\n    \\\\462\\\\ See 2011 SEC Staff Study, note 198 above, at 41 and 86-87. \\nThe rate of ineffective ICFR is based on the findings of management \\nreports on ICFR pursuant to SOX Section 404(a). Because auditor \\nattestations of ICFR are associated with an increased detection and \\ndisclosure of material weaknesses, as discussed above, the rate of \\nineffective ICFR reported by issuers not subject to the auditor \\nattestation requirement may be understated, which would result in \\nthis difference also being understated.\\n    \\\\463\\\\ See, e.g., Audit Analytics, SOX 404 Disclosures: A \\nFourteen Year Review (Sept. 2018) (``2018 Audit Analytics Study''), \\navailable at \\nwww.auditanalytics.com/blog/sox-404-disclosures-a-fourteen-year-review/\\n.\\n    \\\\464\\\\ See Schroeder and Shepardson 2016 Study, note 305 above \\n(using quarterly accruals quality, measured by the level of \\nquarterly discretionary working capital accruals and the quarterly \\naccrual estimation error, as a proxy for internal control quality \\nbased on the argument that internal control improvements should be \\nexhibited in unaudited financial reports).\\n    \\\\465\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\466\\\\ See Vishal Munsif & Meghna Singhvi, Internal Control \\nReporting and Audit Fees of Non-Accelerated Filers, 15(4) J. of \\nAcct., Ethics & Pub.

For example, \\nyounger, loss-incurring issuers with lower market capitalization and \\nlower institutional ownership, as well as those with more segments, \\ntend to be more likely to newly disclose material weaknesses as they \\ntransition into the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\503\\\\ However, \\nthe market appears to account for the association of material \\nweaknesses with these and other observable issuer characteristics. \\nThus, issuers that have the characteristics associated with a higher \\nrate of material weaknesses (and which investors may therefore value \\nunder the assumption that they are likely to have ineffective ICFR) but \\nthat receive an auditor attestation report that does not report any \\nmaterial weaknesses are found to have the greatest cost of capital \\nbenefit from such a report.\\\\504\\\\ Small, loss-incurring issuers are also \\ndisproportionately represented amongst issuers that have allegedly \\nengaged in financial disclosure frauds, indicating that any benefits in \\nterms of investor protection and investor confidence may be \\nparticularly important for this population of issuers.\\\\505\\\\ On the \\nother hand, marginal changes in the reliability of the financial \\nstatements of issuers whose valuation is driven primarily by their \\nfuture prospects--which could also include small, loss-incurring \\nissuers--could have limited issuer- and market-level effects to the \\nextent that the current financial statements of these issuers are less \\ncritical to assessing their valuation.\\\\506\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\503\\\\ See Ge et al. 2017 Study, note 393 above (regarding the \\nterm ``younger,'' this study defines company age as the number of \\nyears a company has been covered in the Compustat database).

Estimated Effects on ICFR, the Reliability of Financial Statements, \\nand Potential Fraud\\n    The academic literature discussed in Section IV.C.3.a. above \\nsuggests that the scrutiny associated with the ICFR auditor attestation \\nmay lead issuers that are required to obtain this attestation to \\nmaintain more effective ICFR and to remediate material weaknesses in \\nICFR more quickly, leading to more reliable financial statements. \\nFurther, as discussed above, studies have highlighted that smaller \\nissuers are disproportionately represented in populations of issuers \\nwith ineffective ICFR and financial statements that require material \\nrestatement. In addition, smaller issuers are less likely to have \\nsignificant external scrutiny in the form of analyst and media coverage \\nand monitoring by institutional owners,\\\\507\\\\ which could otherwise\\n\\n[[Page 17217]]\\n\\nprovide another source of discipline to maintain the reliability of \\nfinancial statements. However, two of the studies cited above find that \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement was not associated with more \\nreliable financial statements for lower market capitalization issuers \\nfrom 2007 through 2013 or 2014,\\\\508\\\\ and the existing studies in \\ngeneral may not be directly applicable to current circumstances given \\nthe 2010 change in risk assessment auditing standards, the 2007 change \\nin the ICFR auditing standard and other recent changes discussed in \\nSection IV.B.1. above. Importantly, the existing literature and most of \\nthe results cited by commenters regarding the benefits of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation also do not directly examine low-revenue issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\507\\\\ See, e.g., Joel Peress & Lily Fang, Media Coverage and the \\nCross-Section of Stock Returns, 64(5) J. of Fin. 2023 at 2030 (2009) \\n(finding that ``firm size has an overwhelming effect on media \\ncoverage: large firms are much more likely to be covered''); Armando \\nGomes, Gary Gorton, & Leonardo Madureira, SEC Regulation Fair \\nDisclosure, Information, and the Cost of Capital, 13 J. of Corp. \\nFin. 300 at 307 (2007) (stating that ``there is overwhelming \\nevidence that size can explain analyst following''); and Eliezer \\nFich, Jarrad Harford, & Anh Tran, Motivated Monitors: The Importance \\nof Institutional Investors' Portfolio Weights, 118(1) J. of Fin. \\nEcon. 21 (2015) (finding that institutional monitoring is greatest \\nwhen a company represents a significant allocation of funds in the \\ninstitution's portfolio, which is strongly associated with company \\nsize).\\n    \\\\508\\\\ See Bhaskar et al. 2018 Study, note 305 above, as \\ndiscussed in note 474 above, and McCallen et al. 2019 Study, note \\n308 above, as discussed in note 475 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    This section therefore provides an analysis of low-revenue issuers \\nusing recent data to complement the existing studies and better inform \\nour consideration of the possible costs of the amendments. However, \\nsome uncertainty will remain due to the challenges discussed above in \\nmeasurement and in ascribing causality in any such analysis, the \\nlimited sample sizes that result when restricting the analysis to \\nrecent years, and the general difficulty of predicting how the parties \\ninvolved will react to the amendments. As discussed in more detail in \\nthe Proposing Release,\\\\509\\\\ our analysis includes an examination of two \\ncomparison populations of issuers that are not subject to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement but that otherwise have similar \\nresponsibilities with respect to ICFR (i.e., non-accelerated filers, \\nother than EGCs, and EGCs), with consideration given to the ways in \\nwhich these issuers differ from the affected issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\509\\\\ See Sections III.C.2. and III.C.4. of the Proposing \\nRelease, note 4 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    One commenter suggested that we should more carefully consider the \\naudit risks linked to specific industries that are expected to be \\naffected by the amendments, highlighting the banking industry as one \\nthat may have special considerations.\\\\510\\\\ We note that, as discussed \\nabove, the majority of the affected banking issuers are expected to \\nremain subject to the FDIC auditor attestation requirement and \\ntherefore are not expected to be significantly affected by the \\namendments. Further, because of the small sample of affected issuers, \\nwe have a limited ability to split our sample and maintain statistical \\nreliability. However, our aggregate estimates should reflect the \\noverall diversity in the population of affected issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\510\\\\ See letter from CFA Inst.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Another commenter indicated that the primary quantifiable cost of \\nan exemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement stems from \\nmisreporting regarding the effectiveness of ICFR.\\\\511\\\\ While we \\nconsider this effect and its quantifiable implications in more detail \\nbelow, we continue to believe that the incentive provided by the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement to actually maintain better controls \\n(versus just to more accurately report their status) remains a key \\nbenefit with certain quantifiable implications that could be lost due \\nto an exemption from this requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\511\\\\ See letter from Prof. Ge et al.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ni. Effects on the Prevalence of Ineffective ICFR\\n    We first consider possible effects related to the effectiveness of \\nthe affected issuers' ICFR. In the Proposing Release, we presented an \\nanalysis of the rate of ineffective ICFR from 2014-2018 among low-\\nrevenue issuers that are subject to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement compared to low-revenue issuers not subject to this \\nrequirement.\\\\512\\\\ In particular, we compared the reported rate of \\nineffective ICFR in these recent years for accelerated filers that are \\nsubject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement and have revenues \\nof less than $100 million, relative to the reported rate of ineffective \\nICFR for issuers in our comparison populations (non-accelerated filers, \\nother than EGCs, and EGCs, neither of which is required to comply with \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement) that also have revenues of \\nless than $100 million. We focused on SOX Section 404(a) management \\nreports on ICFR, with the caveat that management may not report as many \\nmaterial weaknesses in the absence of an audit of ICFR.\\\\513\\\\ Based on \\nthis analysis, and with consideration for the difference in size, \\nmaturity, and overall resources of the affected issuers versus the \\ncomparison sample, we estimated that an additional 15 percent of the \\naffected issuers may fail to maintain effective ICFR.\\\\514\\\\ We did not \\nreceive comment on this specific estimate or comments providing data or \\nmethodologies that would improve our estimate. Our estimate is \\nconsistent with the estimated effect on ICFR based on a study of \\nissuers transitioning into the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement.\\\\515\\\\ We do not expect the full estimated effect to be \\nexperienced immediately upon effectiveness of the amendments. Instead, \\nas discussed in detail at the end of this section, we expect a movement \\ntowards this higher rate of ineffective ICFR over time as some of the \\naffected issuers make incremental changes in their investment in ICFR \\nand as additional issuers enter the category of affected issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\512\\\\ See Section III.C.4.b. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n    \\\\513\\\\ We separately consider this potential under-reporting of \\nmaterial weaknesses in the analysis below.\\n    \\\\514\\\\ See Section III.C.4.b. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove. We also noted in this section of the Proposing Release, note \\n4 above, that our findings may not be surprising, as certain \\nmaterial weaknesses in ICFR may be corrected by, for example, hiring \\nadditional staff, which managers of an issuer that is not currently \\nproducing much revenue may prefer to defer to a later time. Indeed, \\nabout 80 to 85 percent of the low-revenue issuers reporting \\nineffective ICFR in the comparison populations in 2017 reported at \\nleast one staffing-related material weakness, though these were \\ngenerally accompanied by other types of material weaknesses. See \\nnote 259 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above, and the \\naccompanying text.\\n    \\\\515\\\\ See Ge et al. 2017 Study, note 393 above, at 372 (finding \\nthat 62.5 percent of companies that reported material weaknesses as \\nnon-accelerated filers remediate such weaknesses upon entering \\naccelerated filer status). To compare the result from this study to \\nour estimate, note that we find in Table 7 above that about nine \\npercent of accelerated filers report ineffective ICFR (further, the \\nProposing Release, note 4 above, found that the rate was similar for \\nlow and high revenue issuers). Our estimate of an additional 15 \\npercentage points of the affected issuers reporting ineffective ICFR \\nin the absence of an ICFR auditor attestation requirement would lead \\nto a total of 24 percent (nine percent plus 15 percent) of the \\nissuers reporting material weaknesses in ICFR in the absence of the \\nrequirement as compared to nine percent reporting material \\nweaknesses in ICFR when subjected to the requirement. This is the \\nsame result one would get by applying the 62.5 percent remediation \\nestimate from the cited study. In other words, if 62.5 percent of \\nthe issuers reporting material weaknesses in the absence of the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement remediated their material weaknesses \\nupon entering accelerated filer status and becoming subject to the \\nrequirement, that would mean that the rest of the issuers (37.5 \\npercent) failed to remediate when becoming subject to the \\nrequirement. This would imply that a 24 percent rate of ineffective \\nICFR reported by the issuers in the absence of the requirement would \\ncorrespond to a nine percent rate (24 percent times 37.5 percent) of \\nineffective ICFR reported by the issuers when subjected to the \\nrequirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nii. Effects on the Detection and Disclosure of Material Weaknesses in \\nICFR\\n    Because the previous analysis focuses on disclosed rates of \\nineffective ICFR, it does not address the extent to which the \\namendments may affect the detection and disclosure of material \\nweaknesses\\n\\n[[Page 17218]]\\n\\nin ICFR. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a. above, studies have found \\nthat audits of ICFR often result in the identification and disclosure \\nof material weaknesses that were not previously identified or whose \\nseverity was misclassified in management's initial assessment. Thus, \\nextending the exemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nto the affected issuers may decrease the likelihood that, when these \\nissuers have underlying material weaknesses in ICFR, these material \\nweaknesses are detected and disclosed.\\n    In the Proposing Release, we noted that low-revenue issuers may be \\nless likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose material \\nweaknesses in the absence of an ICFR auditor attestation, perhaps \\nbecause they have less complex financial systems and controls.\\\\516\\\\ \\nConsistent with this hypothesis, we found that the low-revenue issuers \\nthat are not subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement report \\nrelatively high rates of ineffective ICFR despite these reports not \\nbeing subject to the additional scrutiny of an ICFR auditor \\nattestation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\516\\\\ See 2017 SICPG Survey Report, note 419 above, at 6 \\n(finding that 33 percent of survey respondents with revenues of $75 \\nmillion or less reported that they manage no more than 100 total \\ncontrols, as compared to 13 percent of those with revenues of $76 to \\n$700 million and zero percent of those with revenues greater than \\n$700 million).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In the Proposing Release, we did not quantitatively estimate a \\npotential effect on the detection and disclosure of material weaknesses \\nin ICFR, though we did qualitatively consider how the amendments could \\naffect issuers depending on their proclivity to detect and disclose \\nunderlying material weaknesses in the absence of an ICFR auditor \\nattestation.\\\\517\\\\ Several commenters indicated that they expected the \\namendments to affect the detection and disclosure of material \\nweaknesses in ICFR,\\\\518\\\\ with one stating that ``the primary \\nquantifiable cost of 404(b) attestation exemption arises from internal \\ncontrol misreporting.'' \\\\519\\\\ Further, other commenters noted that \\nfactors other than the complexity of issuers' systems and controls, \\nsuch as their accounting personnel resources \\\\520\\\\ or the intricacies \\nof the issuers' business and industry, the strength of their \\ngovernance, the competency of their management, and their international \\nreach,\\\\521\\\\ should be considered in assessing the risk of misreporting \\nwith respect to ICFR effectiveness. In response to these comments, we \\nconducted a quantitative estimation of this effect and its potential \\nimplications.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\517\\\\ See Section III.C.4.c of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n    \\\\518\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst., EY, and Prof. Ge et al.\\n    \\\\519\\\\ See letter from Prof. Ge et al.\\n    \\\\520\\\\ See letters from CAQ and EY.\\n    \\\\521\\\\ See letter from RSM.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Because undetected and undisclosed material weaknesses cannot be \\ndirectly observed, we are not able to directly estimate the extent of \\nsuch issues in our comparison samples of low-revenue issuers that are \\nnot subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. Instead, we \\nrely on a recent study that estimates that an incremental 3.5 percent \\nof issuers misreport their ICFR as being effective when not subject to \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement as compared to when they are \\nsubjected to this requirement.\\\\522\\\\ To obtain this estimate, the study \\nuses the characteristics associated with ineffective ICFR to predict \\nthe actual rate of ineffective ICFR as opposed to the disclosed rate of \\nineffective ICFR, and uses changes in reporting around transitions into \\naccelerated filer status to predict the proportion of suspected \\nmisreporters that would correctly report under an ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement.\\\\523\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\522\\\\ See Ge et al. 2017 Study, note 393 above (estimating, \\nbased on data from 2007 through 2014, that 9.3 percent of non-\\naccelerated filers incorrectly report their ICFR to be effective and \\nthat 38.1 percent of these, or 3.5 percent, would correctly report \\ntheir ICFR to be ineffective if subjected to the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement).\\n    \\\\523\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We directly apply the results from the study and estimate that 3.5 \\npercent of the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirements may misreport that their ICFR is \\neffective, but would not misreport if subjected to those requirements. \\nTo be conservative, we do not adjust this estimate based on our \\nconjecture that low-revenue issuers may be less likely than other \\nissuers to fail to detect and disclose material weaknesses in the \\nabsence of an ICFR auditor attestation, perhaps because they have less \\ncomplex financial systems and controls. However, we note that the \\nestimate may be somewhat inflated to the extent that this conjecture is \\ncorrect.\\niii. Effects on Restatements\\n    We next consider the extent to which the possible effects on \\nreported and unreported material weaknesses in ICFR might translate \\ninto less reliable financial statements. By definition, material \\nweaknesses represent a reasonable possibility that a material \\nmisstatement of the issuer's financial statements will not be prevented \\nor detected on a timely basis,\\\\524\\\\ and as discussed above, existing \\nstudies have demonstrated that ineffective ICFR are associated with \\nless reliable financial statements. Thus, our estimated increase in the \\nrate of ineffective ICFR likely would translate into a decrease in the \\nreliability of the financial statements of the affected issuers. \\nHowever, low-revenue issuers could be less susceptible, on average, to \\nat least certain kinds of misstatements. In particular, 10 to 20 \\npercent of restatements and about 60 percent of the cases of financial \\ndisclosure fraud in recent times have been associated with improper \\nrevenue recognition,\\\\525\\\\ which is less of a risk, for example, for \\nissuers that currently have no revenues.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\524\\\\ See Regulation S-X Rule 1-02(a)(4).\\n    \\\\525\\\\ See Audit Analytics, 2017 Financial Restatements: A \\nSeventeen Year Comparison, (May 2018), available at \\nhttps://blog.auditanalytics.com/2017-financial-restatements-review/\\n, and \\nCOSO 2010 Fraud Study, note 505 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We explored this possibility empirically in the Proposing Release, \\nby comparing the percentage of issuers in different categories that \\neventually restated some of the financial statements that they reported \\nfor a given year, for the years 2014 through 2016. Because we directly \\nconsidered differences in actual restatements across these groups of \\nissuers, these results should incorporate the effects of differences \\nacross the groups in both reported and unreported material weaknesses \\nin ICFR. Our analysis demonstrated that issuers with revenues of less \\nthan $100 million have, on average, restatement rates that are three to \\nnine percentage points lower than those for higher-revenue issuers of \\nthe same filer status.\\\\526\\\\ This result is consistent with low-revenue \\nissuers being less likely to make restatements, even when they \\nexperience high rates of ineffective ICFR, perhaps because they are \\nless susceptible to certain kinds of misstatements (such as those \\nrelated to revenue recognition).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\526\\\\ See Section III.C.4.b. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove. As discussed in the Proposing Release, note 4 above, while \\nobserved restatements reflect misstatements that were detected and \\nmay only be a subset of actual misstatements, we believe that the \\nlower restatement rates for low-revenue issuers are not driven by a \\ndifference in the ability to detect misstatements among these \\ncategories because we see this pattern for issuers with low rates of \\nineffective ICFR as well as for other issuers. This result is also \\nconsistent with the BIO Study, which finds that biotechnology EGCs \\nhave a two to three percentage point lower restatement rate than \\nother non-accelerated or accelerated filers and attribute this to \\ntheir ``absence of product revenue.'' See BIO Study, note 69 above \\n(finding a 6.20 percent restatement rate for biotechnology EGCs \\ncompared to rates of 7.98 percent and 9.25 percent for other non-\\naccelerated and accelerated filers respectively).\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 17219]]\\n\\n    A number of commenters maintained that the risks of financial \\nstatement restatements or misstatements are greater for the issuers \\nthat would not be subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nunder the proposed amendments than for other issuers.\\\\527\\\\ A few of \\nthese commenters cited research that concludes that, since 2003, non-\\naccelerated U.S. filers accounted for 62 percent of the total U.S. \\nfinancial statement restatements.\\\\528\\\\ However, we note that this \\nresearch is not specific to low-revenue issuers, unlike our analysis. \\nAs our analysis in the Proposing Release demonstrated, restatements are \\nless frequent for low-revenue issuers even among non-accelerated \\nfilers. Further, the cited research does not adjust for the high \\nproportion of non-accelerated filers among all issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\527\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CAQ, EY, Grant \\nThornton, IMA, Prof. Barth et al., and RSM.\\n    \\\\528\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ and CFA Inst.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Other commenters noted that low-revenue issuers may be more \\nsusceptible to misstatements in revenue recognition \\\\529\\\\ or in areas \\nother than revenue recognition,\\\\530\\\\ and that a higher risk of \\nmisstatements may be driven by characteristics of these issuers other \\nthan their low revenue, such as their lower resources or fewer \\npersonnel,\\\\531\\\\ complex transactions or arrangements,\\\\532\\\\ or \\nactivities that require significant accounting judgments.\\\\533\\\\ We note \\nthat our analysis is intended to capture all of these risks of \\nrestatements, by directly comparing rates of empirical restatements, \\nand that we still find that the lower revenue issuers, taken in \\naggregate, are less likely to restate their financial statements than \\nother issuers of the same filer status. Thus, while certain subsets of \\nthe affected issuers may be more prone to restatements than others \\nbased on their specific characteristics, on average the affected \\nissuers as a group appear to have a lower overall risk of restatement \\nthan higher-revenue issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\529\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets and Prof. Barth et \\nal.\\n    \\\\530\\\\ See, e.g., letter from BDO.\\n    \\\\531\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ, Crowe, EY, and Grant \\nThornton.\\n    \\\\532\\\\ See, e.g., letter from BDO.\\n    \\\\533\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst. and BDO.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    However, in response to the comments, we further examine the \\nargument that the affected issuers may be less susceptible to certain \\nkinds of misstatements, such as those related to revenue recognition, \\nby examining the types of restatements among low- and higher-revenue \\naccelerated filers other than EGCs in Table 11.\\\\534\\\\ We note that the \\ncategorization of types and the names of these categories are based on \\nthe categories and category titles provided in the Ives Group Audit \\nAnalytics restatement database.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\534\\\\ These estimates are based on staff analysis of data from \\nIves Group Audit Analytics.

The table presents the results for the 15 most common \\nrestatement categories for low-revenue accelerated filers other than \\nEGCs. Restatements can fall into more than one category, so the total \\nof these percentages across all restatement categories would exceed the \\naverage rate of restatements. We also report the relative percentage of \\nthe restatement rate in a given category among the low-revenue issuers \\nrelative to the higher-revenue issuers.\\n    Table 11 demonstrates that 1.3 percent of low-revenue accelerated \\nfilers other than EGCs restated their financial statements for a given \\nyear from 2014 to 2018 due to revenue recognition issuers, representing \\nabout 40 percent of the rate of this type of restatement among higher-\\nrevenue accelerated filers other than EGCs. Similarly, for the next \\nthree most common categories of restatements for low-revenue \\naccelerated filers other than EGCs, the restatement rates of these \\nissuers represented 42- to 60 percent of the corresponding rates among \\nhigher-revenue accelerated filers other than EGCs. Thus, this evidence \\nsupports our belief that the affected issuers may be less susceptible \\nto certain kinds of misstatements, such as those related to revenue \\nrecognition. However, consistent with commenters concerns about other \\nsources of misstatements, particularly with respect to complex \\ncontracts and arrangements, we find that the rate of restatements in \\nsome other categories is more similar across the two groups. For \\nexample, the rate of restatements related to ``Debt, quasi-debt, \\nwarrants & equity (BCF) security\\n\\n[[Page 17220]]\\n\\nissues'' and ``Deferred, stock-based and/or executive comp issues'' for \\nthe low-revenue issuers represent 115 percent and 85 percent \\nrespectively of the corresponding rates among the higher-revenue \\nissuers. However, the rate of restatements is greater for the low-\\nrevenue issuers as compared to higher-revenue issuers only in the \\n``Debt, quasi-debt, warrants & equity (BCF) security issues'' category, \\nand only by a small margin: The restatement rates in this category are \\nwithin 0.1 percentage points of each other, such that they are not \\nstatistically differentiable in our sample.\\\\535\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\535\\\\ There is also a slightly higher rate of restatements \\nwithout a specified category among the low-revenue issuers, with 0.1 \\npercent of their issuer-year level observations being associated \\nwith ``Unspecified (amounts or accounts) restatement adjustments'' \\ncompared to 0.0 percent among the higher-revenue issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We therefore continue to believe that the evidence supports our \\nhypothesis that the affected issuers are less likely to make \\nrestatements, perhaps because they are, on average, less susceptible to \\ncertain kinds of misstatements (such as those related to revenue \\nrecognition), than other accelerated filers. While this finding may \\nmitigate the adverse effects on the reliability of financial statements \\nfor the affected issuers that will newly be exempt from all ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirements, we nonetheless expect some such \\neffects. Based on the analysis in the Proposing Release, and with \\nconsideration for the difference in size and maturity of the affected \\nissuers versus the comparison sample, we estimated that the rate of \\nrestatements among the affected issuers may increase by two percentage \\npoints.\\\\536\\\\ Given their lower current rates of restatement, even after \\nsuch an increase the affected issuers may, on average, restate their \\nfinancial statements at a rate that is lower than that of issuers that \\nwill remain accelerated filers, and that does not exceed that of non-\\naccelerated filers and EGCs with comparable revenues.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\536\\\\ See Section III.C.4.b. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters indicated that we should have given \\nconsideration to the magnitude of restatements.\\\\537\\\\ In response to \\nthese comments, we have undertaken two types of analysis. First, we \\nconsider the potential effects on restatements that are deemed by \\nissuers to be material. To do this, we begin by repeating our analysis \\nfor all types of restatements from the Proposing Release for the subset \\nof Item 4.02 restatements, which, as discussed above, are the \\nrestatements that issuers deem to be material and report in Form 8-K \\nItem 4.02 disclosures, in Table 12.\\\\538\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\537\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CFA Inst., and \\nProf. Barth et al.\\n    \\\\538\\\\ The estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of \\nIves Group Audit Analytics data. Percentages are computed out of all \\nissuers of a given filer type and revenue category with revenue data \\nand a SOX Section 404(a) management report available in the Ives \\nGroup Audit Analytics database. The accelerated and non-accelerated \\ncategories exclude EGCs.

Following our analysis in the \\nProposing Release, given the difference in size and maturity of the \\naffected issuers versus the comparison samples, we look to the lower \\nend of this range and, with rounding, estimate that the rate of Item \\n4.02 restatements among the affected issuers may increase by 0.5 \\npercentage points. Given how low the rates of Item 4.02 restatements \\nare, the sample sizes in Table 12 are not sufficient to reliably \\ndifferentiate between these rates. We are nevertheless comfortable with \\nthis estimate because it is consistent with the estimate that would be \\nobtained by applying the average rate of Item 4.02 restatements out of \\nall restatements, per Table 9 above,\\\\539\\\\ to our estimate of the effect \\non total restatements.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\539\\\\ The ratio of Item 4.02 restatements to all restatements in \\nTable 7 ranges from 15 percent for large accelerated filers other \\nthan EGCs (1.6 percent divided by 10.6 percent) up to 35 percent for \\nnon-accelerated filers other than EGCs (2.9 percent divided by 8.5 \\npercent). Applying these rates to our estimated 2 percentage point \\neffect on total restatements would result in an estimate of a 0.3 to \\n0.7 percentage point effect on Item 4.02 restatements.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    This estimate of the effects on restatements that issuers deem to \\nbe material may help to provide some perspective on the magnitude of \\nthe anticipated effect. We provide further analysis of these magnitudes \\nby exploring the market and financial statement impacts of the \\nestimated effect on restatements. Table 15 in Section IV.C.3.c below \\nprovides related estimates per Item 4.02 restatement for low-revenue, \\nseasoned issuers. In particular, the average net income impact for Item \\n4.02 restatements is estimated to be -$1.9 million per year of restated \\nfinancials for the 80 percent of cases where there is a net income \\nimpact, which is -$1.9 million times 80 percent or -$1.5 million on \\naverage across all cases. The average stock market impact is estimated \\nto be -$1.4\\n\\n[[Page 17221]]\\n\\nmillion divided by 1.4 years or -$1 million per year of restated \\nfinancials. We multiply these estimates by our estimate that an \\nadditional 0.5 percentage points of the affected issuers may have an \\nItem 4.02 restatement of their financial statements for a given year to \\nobtain estimates of -$7,500 in net income impact or -$5,000 in stock \\nmarket impact per year per affected issuer that will newly be exempt \\nfrom all ICFR auditor attestation requirements.\\n    One commenter provided alternative estimates of the magnitude of \\nthe effect on restatements, estimating that the affected issuers \\nrestated a total of $295 million in net income over the five years from \\n2014 through 2018 and that the 2018 restatements reduced market \\ncapitalizations by $294 million in aggregate.\\\\540\\\\ We do not rely on \\nthese estimates for two primary reasons. First, these estimates reflect \\nrestatements that have occurred while these issuers are subject to the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\\\541\\\\ They do not provide us with \\ninformation about the magnitude of new restatements that would be \\nexperienced if this requirement were to be removed. The use of this \\nestimate would reflect an assumption that restatements would increase \\nby 100 percent upon removal of the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement, and we do not believe that there is evidence to support \\nsuch an assumption. If anything, these estimates demonstrate the \\nlimitations of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, in that \\nsignificant restatements still occur despite the requirement, rather \\nthan informing us of the risks of removing the requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\540\\\\ See letter from Prof. Barth et al. See also letter from \\nBetter Markets, citing these estimates.\\n    \\\\541\\\\ Similarly, one commenter cites charges of misconduct at a \\nlow-revenue issuer and argues that ``a well-designed ICFR audit \\nmight have uncovered the control deficiencies, and related revenue \\nrecognition violations, more quickly.'' See letter from CFA. \\nHowever, based on its EDGAR filings, the issuer was in fact subject \\nto the ICFR auditor attestation requirement in fiscal year 2014, the \\nbeginning of the period of alleged misconduct (and may have been \\nsubject to the requirement in the remainder of the period of alleged \\nmisconduct as well, but did not file Form 10-K in the following \\nyear), and the auditor's report in the associated Form 10-K attested \\nthat the issuer's ICFR was effective.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Secondly, these estimates reflect the years in which restatements \\nwere announced rather than when the actual misstatement occurred. \\nEffective ICFR is intended to reduce the risk of material \\nmisstatements, so we believe it is important to focus on when \\nmisstatements occurred, not when earlier misstatements were detected \\nand announced, which could actually be a sign of a careful audit and \\neffective ICFR. Focusing on the year of the restatement announcement \\nrather than the year of the misstatement could capture firms that may \\nnot have qualified as affected issuers during the time the \\nmisstatements were made, but only dropped into the category of affected \\nissuers because of the reduction in public float or revenue that \\nresulted from the major restatement and related issues.\\\\542\\\\ In \\ncontrast to the commenter's analysis, our analysis is designed to \\nmeasure the rate and magnitude of the incremental restatements that can \\nbe attributed to misstatements in years in which the issuers would \\nqualify under the amendments to be exempt from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement and that would not have occurred if the issuers \\nwere subjected to this requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\542\\\\ For example, a media report identified a particular issuer \\nincluded in one commenter's analysis of significant restatements \\namong issuers that were proposed to be exempted. See Dave Michaels, \\nSEC Plan Gives Audit Relief to Firms that Wiped Out over $290 \\nMillion, Wall St. J., July 26, 2019. See also letter from Prof. \\nBarth et al. (providing statistics but not identifying specific \\nissuers). Based on its EDGAR filings, the identified issuer had \\nrevenues substantially in excess of $100 million, even after the \\nrevisions described in the article, for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 \\n(the periods with misstatements that were later restated). Further, \\nthis issuer was subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nas a large accelerated filer in 2015 and an accelerated filer in \\n2016. Therefore, we do not believe the amendments, if effective \\nduring those fiscal years, would have exempted this issuer from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement during the period in which the \\nmisstatements were made.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\niv. Effects on Fraudulent Financial Reporting\\n    Several commenters indicated that we should give additional \\nconsideration to the potential impacts of the amendments on the risk of \\nfraud.\\\\543\\\\ Further, a number of commenters cautioned that the risks of \\nfraudulent financial reporting may be particularly high for low-revenue \\nissuers,\\\\544\\\\ perhaps because of their incentives to demonstrate strong \\ngrowth \\\\545\\\\ or because of their high implied price-to-revenue \\nmultiples.\\\\546\\\\ As part of our consideration of these comments, we \\nconducted certain supplemental analysis regarding the risk of \\nfraudulent financial reporting. That analysis, discussed below, \\nprovides additional context for considering the possible effects of the \\namendments. We note that commenters did not provide their own analyses \\nor suggest specific methodologies for estimating any potential impact \\nof the amendments on the risk of fraud.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\543\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA Inst., CII, and Prof. Barth et \\nal.\\n    \\\\544\\\\ See, e.g., letter from CFA, CFA Inst., CII and Prof. Barth \\net al.\\n    \\\\545\\\\ See, e.g., letter from CFA.\\n    \\\\546\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CII and Prof. Barth et al.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We acknowledge that fraudulent misconduct does occur, including at \\nlow-revenue issuers, and that the incentives to engage in such \\nmisconduct could be heightened for certain low-revenue issuers, \\ndepending on their specific situation. It is less clear what the \\naverage risk of fraud is across low-revenue issuers in general, and how \\nthis overall risk may be affected by the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement. Measuring these effects is challenging because the sample \\nsizes associated with typical measures of fraud are small, making \\nreliable statistical determinations difficult. Further, we do not have \\nan observable measure of all latent fraudulent conduct, but can only \\nexamine fraud that has been detected and that led to some observable \\naction, which may not be a representative sample of all actual \\nfraudulent activity. However, we acknowledge that it is important to \\ncarefully consider the potential impact of the amendments on the risk \\nof fraud. We therefore use the available evidence and data to analyze \\nthis risk.\\n    We start by considering Accounting and Auditing Enforcement \\nReleases (``AAERs'') \\\\547\\\\ and cases of ``financial misconduct'' or \\n``financial reporting fraud'' based on subsets of these enforcement \\nactions, as discussed below. A commenter noted that the Proposing \\nRelease did not consider the historical rate of fraud, the incidence of \\nAAERs, the incidence of Wells notices and of formal SEC \\ninvestigations.\\\\548\\\\ While ``fraud'' may be defined in different ways, \\nour analysis below considers the historical rate of fraud, based on \\nanalysis of a subset of AAERs, and the incidence of AAERs. We believe \\nthat these are more appropriate measures of potential fraud risk, as \\nthey reflect incidents in which the Commission proceeded with charges. \\nIn contrast, formal investigations and Wells notices do not always \\nuncover, and/or result in charges of, wrongdoing.\\\\549\\\\ The small sample \\nsize of\\n\\n[[Page 17222]]\\n\\nAAERs limits our ability to apply the methodology we used to estimate \\nthe potential impact on the prevalence of ineffective ICFR and the rate \\nof restatements \\\\550\\\\ to reliably estimate a potential effect on the \\nincidence of AAERs. Instead, we begin by examining the representation \\nof low-revenue as compared to higher-revenue issuers in the population \\nof issuers with AAERs or subsets of AAERs that include certain types of \\ncharges, as compared to their representation in the broader population \\nof issuers, in order to investigate commenters concerns that the \\naffected issuers may face particularly high risks of fraudulent \\nfinancial reporting. We then separately apply results from existing \\nstudies on fraudulent financial reporting to obtain an estimate of the \\npotential impact of the amendments on such misconduct.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\547\\\\ AAERs refer to certain financial reporting related \\nenforcement actions concerning civil lawsuits brought by the \\nCommission in federal court and notices and orders concerning the \\ninstitution and/or settlement of administrative proceedings.

Marshall AAER Database. As noted below, data on ``financial\\n  misconduct'' charges and ``financial reporting fraud'' charges was\\n  only collected for AAERs issued from 2002 through 2018. While these\\n  charges represent alleged misconduct dating back to as early as 1985,\\n  they are more likely to reflect relatively more recent years than\\n  those reflected in the full sample of AAERs. We therefore note, for\\n  the purpose of consideration of the last two rows of Table 13, that\\n  the percentage of low-revenue issuers among the total issuer-year\\n  observations of seasoned issuers with revenue data is reduced somewhat\\n  in the more recent part of this sample, to about 47 percent when\\n  considering data from fiscal years 1985 through 2016 or about 42\\n  percent when considering data from fiscal years 2000 through 2016.\\n*** This row represents AAERs that the U.S.C. Marshall AAER Database\\n  indicates as being associated with alleged financial misstatements.\\n**** This row represents AAERs among those included in the previous row\\n  that also include charges under Section 13(b)(2)(A) (requiring issuers\\n  to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable\\n  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\n  dispositions of the assets of the issuer), Section 13(b)(2)(B)\\n  (requiring an issuer to devise and maintain a system of internal\\n  accounting controls sufficient to provide certain reasonable\\n  assurances), or Section 13(b)(5) (requiring that no person shall\\n  knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of\\n  internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify any book, record, or\\n  account) of the Securities Exchange Act, or Rules 13b2-1 (requiring\\n  that no person directly or indirectly, falsify or cause to be\\n  falsified, any book, record or account) or 13b2-2 (requiring certain\\n  representations and conduct by directors and officers in connection\\n  with the preparation of required reports and documents) under the\\n  Securities Exchange Act. We only supplemented the U.S.C. Marshall AAER\\n  Database with information about these specific charges where\\n  applicable for AAERs issued from 2002 through 2018 (which include\\n  alleged misconduct associated with financial statements from fiscal\\n  year 1985 through 2016), so the set of AAERs considered in the\\n  computations in this row reflect a substantially smaller population of\\n  AAERs than those included in the second row of this table, which\\n  includes earlier AAERs (issued beginning in 1982). Our estimates do\\n  not significantly change if we remove charges associated only with\\n  third parties rather than the issuer in question and/or its staff from\\n  the sample before running the analysis.\\n***** This row represents AAERs among those included in the previous row\\n  that also include charges under the anti-fraud statutes in Section\\n  17(a)(1) of the Securities Act or Section 10(b) of the Securities\\n  Exchange Act. See also note **** above regarding limitations on the\\n  population of AAERs for which we supplemented the U.S.C. Marshall AAER\\n  Database with information on these charges. Our estimates do not\\n  significantly change if we remove charges associated only with third\\n  parties rather than the issuer in question and/or its staff from the\\n  sample before running the analysis.\\n\\n    In Table 13, we consider all AAERs with alleged financial \\nmisstatements (row 2), as well as two subsets of these AAERs that we \\nidentify for those issued in, roughly, the past two decades.\\\\552\\\\ The \\nfirst subset (row 3) represents those that we can identify as including \\ncharges under Section 13(b)(2)(A), Section 13(b)(2)(B), or Section \\n13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act, or Rules 13b2-1 or 13b2-2 \\nunder the Securities Exchange Act. These cases have been identified by \\nresearchers as representing ``financial misconduct.'' \\\\553\\\\ The second\\n\\n[[Page 17223]]\\n\\nsubset (row 4) is the subset of the ``financial misconduct'' cases that \\nwe can identify as also including charges under Section 17(a)(1) of the \\nSecurities Act or Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, which \\nis one common way of identifying cases of ``financial reporting \\nfraud.'' \\\\554\\\\ We note that others may define ``financial misconduct'' \\nand ``financial reporting fraud'' differently.\\\\555\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\552\\\\ The population of AAERs considered in these subsets is \\nlimited to those issued from 2002 through 2018. See Table 13 above.\\n    \\\\553\\\\ See Jonathan Karpoff, Allison Koester, D. Scott Lee, and \\nGerald Martin, Proxies and Databases in Financial Misconduct \\nResearch, 92(6) Acct. Rev. 129 (2017) (``Karpoff et al. 2017 \\nStudy''). This study also raised concerns about omissions in the \\nU.S.C. Marshall AAER Database, which they refer to as the CFRM \\ndatabase, but they noted that they understood that this issue was \\nbeing addressed and that users of the newer iterations of this \\ndataset, after the date of the study, should face lower or zero \\nrates of effective omissions.\\n    \\\\554\\\\ See, e.g., Karpoff et al. 2017 Study, note 553 above, and \\nCOSO 2010 Fraud Study, note 505 above.\\n    \\\\555\\\\ See, e.g., Karpoff et al. 2017 Study, note 553 above, \\n(describing certain other measures researchers have used and their \\nlimitations), note 553 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Per the second through fourth rows of Table 13, the representation \\nof low-revenue seasoned issuers among all seasoned issuers with any of \\nthese types of AAERs ranges from 24 to 42 percent. For comparison, we \\nalso derive the representation of low-revenue seasoned issuers among \\nall seasoned issuers in the population. Per the first row of Table 13, \\nacross all of the years of our sample, and specifically among the \\nseasoned issuers, 50 percent of the issuer-year observations are \\nassociated with low revenues.\\\\556\\\\ Thus, we do not find evidence based \\non the available data that low-revenue issuers are more highly \\nrepresented in the set of seasoned issuers associated with ``financial \\nmisconduct'' or ``financial reporting fraud'' than they are in the \\noverall population of seasoned issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\556\\\\ While the latter two rows of Table 13, regarding \\n``financial misconduct'' and ``financial reporting fraud,'' are \\nbased on relatively more recent data (AAERs issued from 2002 through \\n2018, reflecting alleged misconduct from 1985 to 2016), we note that \\nconsidering the prevalence of low-revenue issuers in relatively more \\nrecent years does not change our conclusions. For example, the \\npercentage of low-revenue issuers among the total issuer-year \\nobservations of seasoned issuers with revenue data is about 47 \\npercent when considering data from 1985 through 2016 (reaching a \\nminimum of 38 percent in 2016), which still exceeds the 25 to 30 \\npercent of the seasoned issuers associated with ``financial \\nmisconduct'' or ``financial reporting fraud'' that have low \\nrevenues.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    A caveat to this finding is that it only reflects cases of \\ndiscovered and charged alleged misconduct, and may not be \\nrepresentative of all cases of actual misconduct.\\\\557\\\\ Also, this \\nanalysis is limited to the population of AAERs. There may be additional \\ncases of alleged misconduct with respect to financial reporting that \\nare charged but not associated with AAERs, and low-revenue issuers \\ncould be more highly represented among these cases.\\\\558\\\\ Further, even \\nif the affected issuers may not be more likely to engage in fraudulent \\nfinancial reporting than other seasoned issuers on average, certain of \\nthese affected issuers may have heightened incentives to engage in such \\nactivities, as noted by the commenters cited above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\557\\\\ We note that the required data, such as data on revenues, \\nmay be less likely to be available for low-revenue issuers to the \\nextent that, like other small issuers, they are less likely to be \\ncovered by traditional databases. This could reduce our ability to \\ndetect a higher representation of these issuers among those with \\nvarious types of AAERs. However, this should generally be accounted \\nfor in our analysis because we draw comparisons only within the \\npopulation of issuers with available data, and the same limitation \\napplies to our ability to estimate the representation of such \\nissuers in the overall population as in the population with AAERs.\\n    \\\\558\\\\ For example, not all of the enforcement actions listed in \\nthe category of ``Issuer Reporting/Auditing & Accounting'' in the \\nAnnual Report of the Commission's Division of Enforcement are \\nassociated with AAERs. See, e.g., 2019 Annual Report, Division of \\nEnforcement, available at \\nhttps://www.sec.gov/enforcement-annual-report-2019.pdf\\n.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We next consider whether expanding the exemption from the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement for such issuers would affect their \\nlikelihood of engaging in such activities. To address this question, we \\nrely on a study that associates material weaknesses in ICFR with an \\nincreased rate of ``financial reporting fraud.'' \\\\559\\\\ In particular, \\nthe study associates reporting ``entity-level'' material weaknesses in \\nICFR,\\\\560\\\\ but not other types of material weaknesses, with a 1.22 \\npercentage point increase in the rate of ``financial reporting fraud'' \\nover the following three years, or 0.41 percentage points (1.22 divided \\nby three) per year.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\559\\\\ See Donelson et al. 2017 Study, note 470 above. This study \\nidentifies ``financial reporting fraud'' as either (1) the sample of \\n``fraud'' cases in the ``financial misrepresentation dataset'' from \\n\\nwww.fesreg.com\\n that underlies the Karpoff et al. 2017 Study, note \\n553 above, which, based on the latter study, represents the subset \\nof Commission or Department of Justice enforcement actions that \\ninclude charges under Sections 13(b)(2)(A), Section 13(b)(2)(B), or \\nSection 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act, or Rules 13b2-1 or \\n13b2-2 under the Securities Exchange Act, that also include charges \\nunder the anti-fraud statutes in Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities \\nAct or Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act; or (2) settled \\nsecurities class-action lawsuits that allege violations of GAAP.\\n    \\\\560\\\\ This study defines entity-level material weaknesses as \\nthose that Ives Group Audit Analytics identifies as being in any of \\nthe following categories: (1) Non-routine transaction control \\nissues; (2) journal entry control issues; (3) foreign, related-\\nparty, affiliated, or subsidiary issues; (4) an ineffective, \\nnonexistent, or understaffed audit committee; (5) senior management \\ncompetency, tone, or reliability issues; (6) an insufficient or \\nnonexistent internal audit function; (7) ethical or compliance \\nissues with personnel; or (8) accounting personnel resources, \\ncompetency, or training issues. See Donelson et al. 2017 Study, note \\n470 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Given that any impact of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\non the risk of fraud is likely to result from the effect of this \\nrequirement on the effectiveness of ICFR, we apply the results of this \\nstudy to our estimated effect on ICFR to quantify the potential \\nincrease in this risk that could be associated with the amendments. Per \\nthe results earlier in this section, we estimate that the amendments \\nmay eventually result in an additional 15 percentage points of the \\naffected issuers maintaining ineffective ICFR. Examining the types of \\nmaterial weaknesses experienced by low-revenue issuers of different \\nfiler statuses, we find that up to 85 percent of their material \\nweaknesses would be classified as ``entity-level'' material weaknesses \\nas defined by the study we are relying on.\\\\561\\\\ Applying the above \\nannualized estimate of a 0.41 percentage point increase in the rate of \\nfinancial reporting fraud for issuers reporting ``entity-level'' \\nmaterial weaknesses to our estimate of a 12.75 percentage point (15 \\npercentage points times 85 percent) increase in the prevalence of such \\nmaterial weaknesses, we estimate that the amendments could eventually \\nlead to an additional 0.05 percentage points (0.41 percent times 12.75 \\npercentage points) of the affected issuers being associated with \\nalleged ``financial reporting fraud'' with respect to their financial \\nstatements for a given year.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\561\\\\ See note 560 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To better understand the magnitude of this potential effect, we \\nrely on another study that estimates that issuers lose a total of 38 \\npercent of their equity market value upon announcements of ``financial \\nmisrepresentation,'' or, given that the alleged violation periods in \\ntheir sample span 27 months on average, 17 percent of equity market \\ncapitalization for each affected year.\\\\562\\\\ The affected issuers that \\nwill be newly exempt from all ICFR auditor attestation requirements \\nhave an average equity market capitalization of about $205 million. We \\ntherefore estimate that the magnitude of the potential increase in \\nfraud risk is 0.05 percentage points (our estimated annualized rate of \\nthe increase in issuer-years associated with\\n\\n[[Page 17224]]\\n\\n``financial reporting fraud'') times 17 percent times $205 million, or \\nabout $17,500 in market capitalization per year per affected issuer \\nthat will be newly exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirements. We view this estimate as conservative because the study \\nwe rely on includes issuers that are younger and significantly smaller \\nthan the affected issuers, and we believe that the percentage of market \\ncapitalization loss is likely to be greater for such firms.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\562\\\\ See Jonathan Karpoff, D. Scott Lee, and Gerald Martin, The \\nCost to Firms of Cooking the Books, 48(3) J. of Fin. and \\nQuantitative Analysis 581 (2008) (``Karpoff et al. 2008 Study''). \\nThe study defines ``financial misrepresentation'' consistently with \\nthe ``financial misrepresentation dataset'' from \\nwww.fesreg.com\\n \\nwhich, based on the Karpoff et al. 2017 Study, note 553 above, \\nrepresents the subset of Commission or Department of Justice \\nenforcement actions that include charges under Sections 13(b)(2)(A), \\nSection 13(b)(2)(B), or Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange \\nAct, or Rules 13b2-1 or 13b2-2 under the Securities Exchange Act. \\nWhile the ``financial misrepresentation'' sample does not also \\nrequire charges under the anti-fraud statutes, the Karpoff et al. \\n2008 Study indicates that over three-fourths of this sample was \\nassociated with fraud charges.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Overall, this analysis does not cause us to change our primary \\nconclusions regarding the potential effects of the amendments.\\nv. Timing of the Effects\\n    We anticipate that the potential adverse effects of the amendments \\nwill develop gradually and are likely to be relatively limited in the \\nshort term. We discuss the reasons that we expect a gradual evolution \\nin the remainder of this section. Nevertheless, we recognize that a \\ndelay in realizing some of the associated costs from the amendments \\nwould not necessarily mitigate their ultimate effects. The preceding \\ndiscussion is based on the comparison of steady-state differences \\nacross issuers in different categories, and represents an analysis of \\nthe eventual effects of the amendments. Because the amendments will \\nallow some current accelerated filers to transition to non-accelerated \\nfiler status, some issuers that have already been subject to an audit \\nof ICFR for one or more years may no longer be required to obtain an \\nICFR auditor attestation. While other issuers will enter into the \\naffected issuers category without having previously obtained an ICFR \\nauditor attestation, and such issuers are likely to represent a larger \\nfraction of the affected issuers over time, initially issuers with \\nexperience with ICFR auditor attestations are expected to represent a \\nsubstantial fraction of the affected issuers.\\n    Newly exempt issuers may have implemented control improvements that \\nwould persist regardless of a transition. For example, they may have \\nmade investments in systems, procedures, or training that are unlikely \\nto be reversed. It is difficult to predict the degree of inertia in \\nICFR and financial reporting in order to gauge how quickly, if at all, \\nissuers that cease audits of ICFR may evolve such that their ICFR and \\nthe reliability of their financial statements is more characteristic of \\nexempt issuers.\\\\563\\\\ The gradual nature of such an evolution, and the \\nassociated halo effect of the last disclosed ICFR auditor attestation, \\nmay limit the short-term costs of the amendments. In addition, issuers \\nthat believe control improvements are valuable for reporting and \\ncertifying results will be free to spend the resources saved on the \\nattestations on such improvements.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\563\\\\ We note that there is a relatively small sample of \\naccelerated filers transitioning to non-accelerated filer status \\nbecause of changes in their public float, as compared to transitions \\nin the other direction, and that such transitions likely represent \\nspecial circumstances such as underperformance. Therefore, such \\ntransitions are not particularly helpful for predicting the outcomes \\nof accelerated filers transitioning to non-accelerated filer status \\nbecause of the amendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Affected issuers with experience with audits of ICFR may also be \\nmore likely to continue to obtain an ICFR auditor attestation on a \\nvoluntary basis than other exempt issuers are to begin voluntary audits \\nof ICFR. This may be due to such issuers having already incurred \\ncertain start-up costs or facing demand from their current investors to \\ncontinue to provide ICFR auditor attestations. Some issuers in the \\ngroups that we use for comparison, which are not subject to an ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement, voluntarily obtain an ICFR auditor \\nattestation. Thus, the comparisons made above at least partially \\naccount for the fact that some issuers may choose to obtain an ICFR \\nauditor attestation even in the absence of a requirement. However, to \\nthe extent the rate of voluntary ICFR auditor attestations would be \\nhigher amongst the issuers that will be newly exempt from the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement than other exempt issuers, the \\nanticipated costs of the amendments in the near term may be further \\nreduced.\\nc. Implications for Investor Decision-Making\\n    While we anticipate that the frequency of ineffective ICFR and, to \\na lesser extent, restatements may increase among the affected issuers \\nas a result of the amendments, the economic effects of these changes \\nmay be reduced by another factor that may apply to many of these \\nissuers. In particular, the usefulness of more reliable financial \\nstatements is linked to the degree to which they factor into the \\ndecisions of investors,\\\\564\\\\ for example, with respect to these \\ninvestors' valuations of issuers.\\\\565\\\\ The financial statements of many \\nlow-revenue issuers may have relatively lower relevance for market \\nperformance if, for example, relative to higher-revenue issuers, their \\nvaluation hinges more on their future prospects than on their current \\nfinancial performance.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\564\\\\ See, e.g., Dechow and Schrand 2004 Monograph, note 506 \\nabove.\\n    \\\\565\\\\ See, e.g., Jennifer Francis & Katherine Schipper, Have \\nFinancial Statements Lost Their Relevance?, 37(2) J. of Acct. Res. \\n319 (1999) (``Francis and Schipper 1999 Study''); and S. P. Kothari, \\nCapital Markets Research in Accounting, 31 J. of Acct. and Econ. 105 \\n(2001).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We explored this possibility empirically in the Proposing Release, \\nwhich used the methodology applied in previous studies to calculate, \\nfor issuers above and below the $100 million revenue threshold, the \\nextent to which the variation in market performance is related to the \\nvariation in financial measures. For issuers at or above $100 million \\nin revenue, we found, consistent with the findings of previous studies \\nof all issuers, that key financial variables (the book value of assets \\nand liabilities, the book value of equity, earnings, and the change in \\nearnings) explain about 60 to 70 percent of the variation in equity \\nmarket capitalization and 7.5 percent of the variation in stock \\nreturns.\\\\566\\\\ In contrast, for issuers with revenues of less than $100 \\nmillion, we found that these financial variables explain about 30 \\npercent of the variation in equity market capitalization and just over \\n4.5 percent of the variation in stock returns.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\566\\\\ See Table 15 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above. See \\nalso Francis and Schipper 1999 Study note 565 above. While that \\nstudy ends in 1994, before our 20 year horizon, the results are \\nsimilar. For example, for the most recent ten years in that study, \\nthe book values of assets and liabilities explain 54 to 70 percent \\nof the variation in equity market valuation, the book value of \\nequity and earnings explain 63 to 78 percent of the variation in \\nequity market valuation, and earnings and the change in earnings \\nexplain six to 20 percent of the variation in stock returns.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    One commenter indicated that a low-revenue issuer could have a \\nlarge market capitalization and thus ``greater investor exposure.'' \\n\\\\567\\\\ While we agree that such affected issuers would generally expose \\nmore investors to risk, we note that the results discussed above \\nsuggest that, on average, relative to higher-revenue issuers, less of \\nthis risk seems to be associated with the issuers' current financial \\nstatements than with their future prospects.\\\\568\\\\ Another commenter \\nagreed that future prospects are important to the valuation of entities \\nin a growth phase, but noted that the financial variables we consider \\nin our analysis are more likely to be considered in the valuation of \\nlow-revenue issuers that are more seasoned, and that we should \\ntherefore more fully consider the implications for these issuers in \\nparticular.\\\\569\\\\ This commenter\\n\\n[[Page 17225]]\\n\\nalso suggested that we might consider additional financial variables \\nthat may be more relevant to the valuation of low-revenue issuers, such \\nas the rate of revenue growth and measures of liquidity. In response to \\nthis comment, we conducted supplemental analysis of the empirical \\nrelevance of financial statements for low-revenue issuers in Table \\n14.\\\\570\\\\ Specifically, because the affected issuers that will newly be \\nexempt from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement are generally not \\nwithin five years of their IPO, we limit the analysis to more seasoned \\nissuers. Further, we run the analysis with additional variables, as \\ndiscussed below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\567\\\\ See letter from Grant Thornton.\\n    \\\\568\\\\ Also, the affected parties are limited to issuers with no \\nmore than $700 million in public float. Further, as discussed in \\nSection IV.C.3.d. below, we estimate that in aggregate the affected \\nissuers that will be newly exempt from all ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirements represent 0.2 percent of the total equity market \\ncapitalization of issuers.\\n    \\\\569\\\\ See letter from Crane.\\n    \\\\570\\\\ The reported statistics are adjusted R-squared statistics \\nbased on regression analysis by staff using data from the Standard & \\nPoor's Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices \\ndatabases. Seasoned issuers are those for which the data date is not \\nwithin five years of the reported IPO date, where IPO dates are \\navailable. Market value and financial variables are measured as of \\nthe end of the fiscal year. Earnings is income before extraordinary \\nitems. Stock return is the 15-month stock return ending three months \\nafter fiscal year-end, to account for reporting lags. For the stock \\nreturn regression, the explanatory variables are scaled by the \\nlagged market value of equity, and outliers in one percent tails of \\nvariable distributions are dropped to reduce noise.

Focusing on this subsample of low-revenue issuers, \\nwhich is more representative of the affected issuers that would be \\nnewly exempt from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, we find \\nthat the financial variables considered in the Proposing Release \\nexplain about 40 to 45 percent of the variation in equity market \\ncapitalization and about 5.5 percent of the variation in stock returns. \\nThese percentages are slightly higher than our results for all low-\\nrevenue issuers in the Proposing Release (for which the variables \\nexplain about 30 percent and 4.5 percent of the variation in equity \\nmarket capitalization and stock returns respectively, as noted above). \\nHowever, they remain substantially lower than the results for higher-\\nrevenue seasoned issuers, for which the variables explain about 60 to \\n70 percent of the variation in equity market capitalization and about \\n7.5 percent of the variation in stock returns.\\n    The second panel of Table 14 considers additional variables based \\non the comment letter discussed above and on academic accounting \\nliterature on key value-relevant metrics. For example, the role of the \\nbook value of equity in valuation may reflect, among other things, the \\nliquidation or adaptation value of an issuer.\\\\571\\\\ However, a commenter \\nnoted that, for issuers with little to no revenue, liquidity metrics \\nare often relevant to a user's evaluation of future prospects.\\\\572\\\\ We \\nagree that there is evidence that, for certain issuers, liquidity \\nmetrics that relate current assets to current liabilities may provide \\nkey additional information on the likelihood of, and value upon, \\nliquidation.\\\\573\\\\ We therefore include the quick ratio (current assets \\nless inventories, which may be difficult to monetize in the short term, \\nminus current liabilities) in the analysis as a supplement to the book \\nvalue of equity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\571\\\\ See, e.g., Philip Berger, Eli Ofek, and Itzahk Swary, \\nInvestor Valuation of the Abandonment Option, 42(2) J. of Fin.

However, the percentage of explained variation \\nremains lower for low-revenue seasoned issuers than for higher-revenue \\nseasoned issuers.\\n    These results demonstrate that financial statement information is \\nnot irrelevant for low-revenue issuers. That is, information from \\nfinancial statements is associated with market prices and returns for \\nthese issuers as well as other issuers. Thus, the potential reduction \\nin the reliability of financial\\n\\n[[Page 17226]]\\n\\nstatements for the affected issuers is expected to have some negative \\nimplications. However, the lower empirical relevance of financial \\nstatements on average for these issuers may partially mitigate the \\npotential adverse effects of the amendments.\\n    In contrast to these findings, a number of commenters cited \\nanalysis in Commissioner Jackson's Statement suggesting that, based on \\nthe stock market reaction to annual report filings disclosing material \\nweaknesses in ICFR, investors care most about the information provided \\nby the ICFR auditor attestation of low-revenue issuers.\\\\578\\\\ Further, \\none of these commenters stated that the markets impose a ``much heftier \\npenalty'' on small companies that restate than they do on larger \\ncompanies.\\\\579\\\\ On the other hand, other commenters expressed the view \\nthat the ICFR auditor attestation requirement is not important or \\nmaterial to the investors of affected issuers, based on their own \\nexperience and/or a study referencing an analysis of the market \\nreaction to Section 302 internal control weakness disclosures.\\\\580\\\\ As \\nfurther evidence, two of these commenters asserted that investors \\nrarely ask an issuer that is exempt from obtaining an ICFR auditor \\nattestation to voluntarily comply with the requirement.\\\\581\\\\ In \\nresponse to these comments, we have conducted analyses of the investor \\nresponse to ICFR disclosures and restatement announcements at low-\\nrevenue issuers versus other issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\578\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CFA, CFA Inst., and CII, citing \\nthe event study analysis in Commissioner Jackson's Statement.\\n    \\\\579\\\\ See letter from CFA.\\n    \\\\580\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Adamas, Ardelyx, ASA, BIO, Carver, \\nCatalyst, Chiasma, Corvus, CymaBay, Equillium, Evoke, Gritstone, \\nKezar, Marinus, Millendo, Organovo, Pieris, Revance, SI-BONE, Syros, \\nTeligent, and Zynerba. Many of these letters cited the BIO Study, \\nnote 69 above, which in turn cites Jacqueline Hammersley, Linda \\nMyers, and Catherina Shakespeare, Market Reactions to the Disclosure \\nof Internal Control Weaknesses and to the Characteristics of those \\nWeaknesses under Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, \\n13(1) Rev. of Acct. Stud. 141 (2008) (``Hammersley et al. 2008 \\nStudy''). The BIO letter also directly cites the latter study. The \\nBIO Study and BIO letter highlight the finding of the Hammersley et \\nal. 2008 Study that the market response to issuers disclosing \\nmaterial weaknesses in disclosure controls in their Section 302 \\ndisclosures is, in the whole sample, not statistically different \\nfrom zero. However, we note that this study does find evidence of a \\nstatistically significant negative market reaction to such \\ndisclosures in a subsample uncontaminated by other announcements in \\nthe event window.\\n    \\\\581\\\\ See letters from Ardelyx and BIO.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    First, we consider the market reaction to the filing of annual \\nreports that contain ICFR auditor attestations reporting material \\nweaknesses in ICFR. We only consider ICFR auditor attestation reports, \\nas opposed to Section 404(a) management reports, in order to focus on a \\nsample of issuers comparable to the affected issuers \\\\582\\\\ and those \\nreports that would no longer be required under the amendments. Because \\nmaterial weaknesses may persist across years, consecutive disclosures \\nthat continue to report material weaknesses are not likely to represent \\nnews to the market. We therefore focus on material weakness disclosures \\nthat are preceded by an ICFR auditor attestation reporting effective \\nICFR. We consider issuers with revenues of less than $100 million and \\nhigher-revenue issuers, but exclude those within five years of their \\nIPO to more closely represent the affected issuers.\\\\583\\\\ Figure 7 \\\\584\\\\ \\npresents the results of our event study analysis for disclosures in the \\nlast decade.\\\\585\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\582\\\\ In particular, Section 404(a) management reports are \\nrequired of all issuers other than RICs and ABS issuers, including \\nthose that are already non-accelerated filers and would therefore \\nnot be affected by the amendments.\\n    \\\\583\\\\ We obtain substantially similar results if we consider all \\nissuers, rather than excluding those within five years of their IPO, \\nor if we include consecutive annual reports with material weakness \\ndisclosures, rather than focusing on new material weakness \\ndisclosures.\\n    \\\\584\\\\ This figure is based on results from the Event Study by \\nWRDS module available through Wharton Research Data Services and \\nstaff analysis of data from Ives Group Audit Analytics, Compustat, \\nand CRSP. The figure includes all seasoned issuers that have an \\nauditor attestation of ICFR that newly reports material weaknesses \\nin ICFR following a previous attestation to effective ICFR in annual \\nreports filed in calendar years 2009 through 2018. We exclude \\nissuers for which the data date is within five years of the IPO date \\n(i.e., non-seasoned issuers), if available. The cumulative average \\nabnormal returns are calculated with respect to expected returns \\nbased on a multi-factor model including the three Fama French \\nfactors and a momentum factor, where the model parameters are \\ncalculated over an estimation period of up to 100 trading days \\nending 50 trading days before the event period.\\n    \\\\585\\\\ This time horizon was chosen to maximize the sample size \\nwhile limiting the study to the period after the effectiveness of AS \\nNo. 5 (now referred to as AS 2201, note 292 above), which may have \\nchanged the nature of ICFR auditor attestations. See Section IV.B.1. \\nabove for a discussion of this auditing standard and the evidence \\nthat the nature of ICFR auditor attestations may have changed as a \\nresult of its adoption. Our results are substantially similar when \\nconsidering alternative time horizons, such as the past five years.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[[Page 17227]]\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MR20.006\\n\\n    Our analysis does not suggest that investors care more about the \\ninformation produced by the ICFR auditor attestation requirement at \\nlow-revenue issuers. In particular, investors did not react more \\nnegatively to low-revenue issuers disclosing material weaknesses than \\nto such disclosures by the higher-revenue issuers. None of the \\ncumulative average abnormal returns plotted in the figure, whether for \\nlow- or higher-revenue issuers, are statistically differentiable from \\nzero at conventional confidence levels.\\\\586\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\586\\\\ The analysis applies the standardized cross-sectional \\ntest, which is robust to cross-sectional dependence in abnormal \\nreturns (which often results when events cluster in time, as in the \\ncase of annual report filing dates) as well as any event-induced \\nincrease in the variance of returns, to measure the statistical \\nsignificance of the abnormal returns. See Ekkehart Boehmer, Jim \\nMusumeci, and Annette Poulsen, Event-Study Methodology under \\nConditions of Event-Induced Variance, 30(2) J. of Fin. Econ. 253 \\n(1991) (``Boehmer et al. 1991'').\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Our figure differs from the similar analysis that was cited by \\ncommenters for a number of reasons. First, that analysis includes a \\nnumber of duplicate observations.\\\\587\\\\ The duplication generally occurs \\nwhen there is both an ICFR auditor attestation and a Section 404(a) \\nmanagement report reporting a material weakness in the same annual \\nreport. While the duplicate observations appear to have only a modest \\neffect on the pattern of the measured cumulative abnormal returns, they \\nlikely have the effect of biasing downward the width of the confidence \\ninterval presented in the analysis. When we remove the duplicates, we \\nfind that, as in our own analysis, the cumulative average abnormal \\nreturns for low-revenue issuers are not statistically differentiable \\nfrom zero at conventional confidence levels for any day within the 11-\\nday event period surrounding the disclosure date.\\\\588\\\\ Also, we note \\nthat even without this adjustment, the confidence intervals plotted in \\nthe other analysis indicate that, by the end of the presented event \\nperiod, the cumulative average abnormal returns are no longer \\nstatistically differentiable from zero for issuers with below $100 \\nmillion in revenues.\\\\589\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\587\\\\ About 30% of the low-revenue observations in the analysis \\nare exact duplicates in terms of company identifiers, event date, \\nrevenue and returns. See ``Abnormal Returns Data,'' available at \\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/jackson-statement-proposed-amendments-accelerated-filer-definition\\n.\\n    \\\\588\\\\ The width of the confidence interval at the far right side \\nof the figure (for day +5) in the analysis cited by commenters \\nappears to be about 0.85 percentage points. We understand that the \\nstandard errors in that analysis are simple cross-sectional standard \\nerrors (which are robust to event-induced increases in the variance \\nof returns but not to any cross-sectional dependence in abnormal \\nreturns). Removing the duplicates, we find that the width of the \\ncorresponding 95% confidence interval would be 2.02 percentage \\npoints using this approach, which is about 2.4 times wider than the \\nreported confidence interval.\\n    \\\\589\\\\ In particular, the presented confidence bands for the \\ncumulative abnormal returns include zero by day 11 of the analysis, \\nwhich considers the 11-day period beginning five days prior and \\nending five days subsequent to the date of disclosure.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Second, more than half of the non-duplicate low-revenue \\nobservations in the other analysis appear to reflect reports of \\nmaterial weaknesses in Section 404(a) management reports in the absence \\nof an ICFR auditor attestation. As discussed above, our analysis \\nexcludes observations where there is only a Section 404(a) management \\nreport because we believe they have limited relevance when considering \\nthe affected issuers and the effects of the amendments. Third, the \\nother analysis reflects a different time horizon (2004 through 2017) \\nthan our analysis (2009 through 2018). In our analysis, we restrict the \\ntime horizon to the period after the effectiveness of AS No. 5 because \\nthe nature of ICFR auditor attestations may have changed after this \\npoint. These additional differences in\\n\\n[[Page 17228]]\\n\\nthe underlying sample appear to drive the differences in the pattern of \\nthe cumulative average abnormal returns in the analysis cited by \\ncommenters relative to our own analysis.\\\\590\\\\ However, even if we were \\nto use the broader set of reports and/or the time horizon of the other \\nanalysis, we continue to find that the cumulative average abnormal \\nreturns are not statistically differentiable from zero at conventional \\nconfidence levels for any day within the 11-day event period \\nsurrounding the disclosure date.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\590\\\\ While, as discussed above, we also refine the analysis \\npresented in Figure 7 to exclude consecutive disclosures that \\ncontinue to report material weaknesses and to limit the analysis to \\nseasoned issuers, we find that these choices have more modest \\neffects on the pattern of cumulative average abnormal returns.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    There is substantial noise inherent to an analysis of the \\ndisclosure of material weaknesses in annual reports, both because these \\nreports often contain or are accompanied by significant confounding \\ninformation \\\\591\\\\ and because material weaknesses are often disclosed \\nin advance of the annual report.\\\\592\\\\ We therefore also undertook \\nanalysis of the market and financial statement impact of material \\nrestatements disclosed in Item 4.02 Form 8-K filings, which are \\nrelatively less likely to be accompanied by unrelated news or to be \\ndisclosed in advance of the filing. We consider restatements over the \\n10-year horizon from 2009 through 2018 to obtain more reliable \\nestimates while still focusing on a recent period that should be \\nreasonably representative of the current environment.\\\\593\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\591\\\\ Staff analysis of material weakness disclosures that were \\naccompanied by large positive or negative stock returns found \\nevidence of announcements of confounding news that are associated \\nwith large positive returns (e.g., significantly beat earnings \\nestimates, positive news about Phase III trial, liquidity infusion, \\nmerger announcement) and large negative returns (e.g., significantly \\nmiss earnings estimates, liquidity problems and security issuance at \\nsignificant discount).

Rev 1171 (2009) (for further analysis of the \\ninformation content released in, and at the time of, annual report \\nfiling).\\n    \\\\592\\\\ Staff analysis of material weakness disclosures that were \\npreceded by an ICFR auditor attestation reporting effective ICFR \\nfound that in about one-third of cases these new material weaknesses \\nhad been disclosed prior to the annual report, such as in an Item \\n4.02 Form 8-K or a Form 10-Q filing.\\n    \\\\593\\\\ The estimates in Table 15 are based on staff analysis of \\nrestatements associated with an Item 4.02 8-K dated within calendar \\nyears 2009 through 2018. The sample includes, for issuers that are \\nnot within five years of their IPO, 260 restatements by low-revenue \\nissuers and 384 restatements for higher-revenue issuers with non-\\nmissing stock returns. The data on restatements, including their \\nfinancial statement effects, are from Audit Analytics. Revenues are \\nmeasured as of the beginning of the restated period. The data on \\nrevenues and IPO dates are from Compustat. The announcement returns \\nare cumulative abnormal returns based on results from the Event \\nStudy by WRDS module available through Wharton Research Data \\nServices. They represent the cumulative abnormal returns for the \\ntwo-day event period including the date of the associated 8-K filing \\nand the following trading day. These abnormal returns are estimated \\nrelative to a benchmark model of returns based on the three Fama-\\nFrench factors and a momentum factor, where the model parameters are \\ncalculated over an estimation period of up to 100 trading days \\nending 50 trading days before the event date.

The market \\nreaction to Item 4.02 Form 8-K filings is statistically \\nindistinguishable from zero for low-revenue, seasoned issuers, but is \\nnegative and statistically significant for higher-revenue issuers. \\nWhile the point estimates for the market impact of the restatements are \\nuncertain, as demonstrated by the confidence intervals presented in the \\nsecond row of Table 15, the corresponding point estimates for the \\ndollar market impact per restatement announcement are also \\nsubstantially lower (at $1.4 million versus $22.0 million) for low-\\nrevenue seasoned issuers as compared to higher-revenue seasoned \\nissuers. The rate of Item 4.02 restatements with negative financial \\nstatement impact or with net income impact is similar for both \\ncategories of issuers, at about 80 percent. We also consider how the \\naverage dollar market impact of the restatements relates to the average \\ndollar correction in annualized net income, in case investors react \\nmore strongly per dollar of the correction in annualized net income for \\nlow-revenue issuers. However, Table 15 does not provide evidence that \\nthe corresponding point estimate dollar market impact is \\nproportionately greater relative to the average annualized effect on \\nnet income for low-revenue seasoned issuers than for high revenue \\nseasoned issuers.\\\\594\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\594\\\\ In particular, the ratio of average dollar market impact \\nof the restatements relative to the average dollar correction in \\nannualized net income for low-revenue seasoned issuers is -$1.4M/-\\n$1.9M or about 0.7, while the corresponding ratio for higher-revenue \\nseasoned issuers is -$22.0/-$13.2 or about 1.7.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Overall, we acknowledge that a lower reliability of their financial \\nstatements may have significant effects on the valuation of certain \\nlow-revenue issuers. It is possible, for example, as one commenter \\nstated, that ``[for] many low-revenue companies that are struggling to \\nbecome high revenue companies . . . their ability to attract capital \\nmay depend primarily on their ability to convince analysts and \\ninvestors that their revenues are strong and steadily rising.'' \\\\595\\\\ \\nHowever, when we consider\\n\\n[[Page 17229]]\\n\\nthe evidence in aggregate across the population of low-revenue and \\nhigher-revenue seasoned issuers based on the three different types of \\nanalyses in this section, we find some evidence that financial \\nstatements and their reliability are less associated with market prices \\nfor low-revenue issuers and no evidence that there is a stronger \\nassociation with market prices for low-revenue issuers than for higher-\\nrevenue issuers. Therefore, we continue to believe that the evidence \\nsupports the supposition that relative to higher-revenue issuers, the \\nvalue of low-revenue issuers, on average, hinges more on their future \\nprospects than on their current financial performance, and that this \\nconsideration should mitigate the potential adverse effects of the \\namendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\595\\\\ See letter from CFA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nd. Potential Economic Costs of Effects on ICFR, the Reliability of \\nFinancial Statements, and Potential Fraud\\n    A number of commenters indicated that we should make further \\nattempts to quantify the potential costs of the amendments.\\\\596\\\\ A few \\ncommenters further asserted that the costs of the amendments will \\nsignificantly outweigh any benefits.\\\\597\\\\ In the previous section, we \\nestimated that the affected issuers that will newly be exempt from all \\nICFR auditor attestation requirements may eventually experience a 15 \\npercentage point increase in ineffective ICFR and, for a given year of \\nfinancial statements, an estimated 2 percentage point increase in \\nrestatements, a 0.5 percentage point increase in Item 4.02 \\nrestatements, and a 0.05 percentage point increase in ``financial \\nreporting fraud'' associated with those financial statements. In this \\nsection, we provide additional monetized estimates of the impact, in \\ndollar terms, which may be associated with certain potential adverse \\neffects. As noted earlier, this discussion and these estimates are \\nfocused on affected issuers that will be newly exempt from the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement and are not expected to be subject to \\nthe FDIC auditor attestation requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\596\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets, CFA Inst., CII, \\nProf. Barth et al., and Prof. Ge et al.\\n    \\\\597\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets and Prof. Barth et \\nal.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Overall, as discussed in more detail below, we are able to \\nquantitatively estimate, per year per affected issuer, a total of \\napproximately $60,000 in costs and an additional approximately $10,000 \\nin transfers across shareholders, which represent costs to some \\nshareholders and benefits to other shareholders.\\\\598\\\\ These estimates \\nreflect our quantification, based on the available evidence and data, \\nof potential effects related to operating performance, restatements, \\nand financial reporting fraud. We note that we are unable to adjust the \\ndominant component of the estimates (the estimated effect on operating \\nperformance) for the mitigating factors associated with low-revenue \\nissuers that we discuss throughout this release, so the total estimate \\nof costs may be inflated.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\598\\\\ The costs we estimate represent actual forgone value, \\nwhile the transfers simply represent corrections to reflect an \\nissuer's true financial position.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Given that our estimate of the cost savings per year per affected \\nissuer is $210,000, we do not find evidence to support the views of the \\ncommenters that indicated that the costs of the amendments would \\nsignificantly outweigh the benefits. However, we note two main caveats \\nassociated with our estimates of the costs and transfer that may result \\nfrom the amendments, and with the underlying components of these \\nestimates, which are discussed in more detail below. First, these \\nestimates are necessarily more uncertain than our monetized estimates \\nof cost savings to issuers because they are based on a larger number of \\nassumptions. Secondly, we caution against attempts to over-interpret \\nthe relation between our quantitative estimates of monetized benefits \\nand monetized costs, because neither of these measures is complete. For \\nexample, we are not able to monetize the potential benefit of reduced \\nmanagement distraction from operating activities \\\\599\\\\ or the potential \\nmarket-level costs of reduced efficiency of investor allocation across \\ninvestment opportunities or reduced investor confidence.\\\\600\\\\ We \\ntherefore are not able to quantify the overall net benefit or cost of \\nthe amendments.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\599\\\\ See, e.g., letter from Sutro.\\n    \\\\600\\\\ See, e.g., letter from CII.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ni. Computation of Monetized Estimates of Costs\\n    We provide further quantification of potential adverse effects of \\nthe amendments in this section, while the next section provides a \\ndiscussion of these costs as well as other economic costs that we are \\nunable to quantify. We begin by considering costs that may represent \\ndeadweight losses, or net costs to society, followed by a consideration \\nof transfers across shareholders. First, we estimate the potential \\ndeadweight losses associated with a potential increase in the risk of \\nfraud. In Section IV.C.3.b.iv. above, we estimated the magnitude of the \\npotential increase in fraud risk to be about $17,500 in market \\ncapitalization per year per affected issuer that will be newly exempt \\nfrom the ICFR auditor attestation requirements. A study that breaks \\ndown the equity market impact of fraud into deadweight losses (such as \\nlegal costs and impaired reputation) versus the effects that reflect \\nthe market adjusting to a more accurate representation of issuers' \\nfinancial situations estimates that the former constitute approximately \\n75 percent of the total equity market loss.\\\\601\\\\ We therefore estimate \\nthe potential average incremental deadweight loss associated with fraud \\nto be $17,500 times 75 percent or roughly $13,000 per year per affected \\nissuer. We consider the remainder of the estimated equity market \\neffect, which represents a transfer from some investors to other \\ninvestors, separately below.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\601\\\\ See Karpoff et al. 2008 Study, note 562 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Commenters suggested that we should quantify effects on operating \\nperformance associated with ICFR misreporting,\\\\602\\\\ which are less \\nlikely to be corrected by remediation because the underlying material \\nweaknesses are likely undetected. As discussed in the Proposing \\nRelease, potential effects of the amendments on operating performance \\nare difficult to measure because the existing studies may not be \\ngeneralizable to the affected issuers and the methods used in previous \\nstudies are difficult to apply to a comparable sample of low-revenue \\nissuers in recent years.\\\\603\\\\ However, in response to these comments, \\nwe rely on the results of a recent study \\\\604\\\\ to provide an estimate \\nof the possible loss in profits per year associated with ICFR \\nmisreporting. While we expect that the anticipated effect on the \\naffected issuers would be reduced relative to those in the study given \\nthe mitigating factors specific to low-revenue issuers discussed above, \\nwe are unable to estimate an appropriate adjustment to reflect these \\nfactors. The study estimates that the difference in return on assets \\nfor issuers misreporting that they have effective ICFR versus those \\nthat properly report that they have ineffective ICFR (and thereby \\nperhaps also work towards remediating their ICFR) is 3.3 percentage \\npoints over three years, or 1.1 percentage point per year. We multiply \\nthis difference by our estimate of the potential increase in \\nmisreporting of effective ICFR from Section IV.C.3.b.ii. above, which \\n(based on statistics from the same study) is 3.5 percentage points, and \\nthe estimated average total assets of the affected\\n\\n[[Page 17230]]\\n\\nissuers that will be newly exempt from all ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirements from Section IV.C.1 above, which is $125 million. This \\nresults in an estimated reduction in potential earnings of about \\n$48,000 per year on average for an affected issuer. As noted above, \\nthis estimate may be inflated, as it does not reflect any of the \\nmitigating factors specific to low-revenue issuers discussed above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\602\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CII, Prof. Barth et al., and Prof. \\nGe et al.\\n    \\\\603\\\\ See Section III.C.4.c. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n    \\\\604\\\\ See Ge et al. 2017 Study, note 393 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In total, we estimate potential issuer-level costs of $48,000 in \\nreduced earnings plus $13,000 in losses related to the increased risk \\nof fraud, or roughly $60,000 in costs per year on average per affected \\nissuer, though we view this estimate as conservative because it does \\nnot fully account for the mitigating factors discussed above. Next, we \\nnote that some of the potential adverse effects quantified in Section \\nIV.C.3.b. above may be associated with stock market values that fail, \\nat a given time, to reflect issuers' actual financial position. This \\npotential inflation and later correction of stock market values would \\nresult in transfers that benefit some shareholders and harm other \\nshareholders. Further, the same shareholder may benefit in certain of \\nhis shareholdings and be harmed in other shareholdings. Also, at any \\ngiven time, the stock price may be inflated for certain reasons but \\nhave corrected for other prior inflation, depending on the timing of \\nthe revelation of the underlying issues. For the purpose of \\nquantification of these potential transfers, we assume that issues are \\nrevealed gradually and smoothly over time, such that there is an even \\neffect across years.\\n    The first source of mispricing we consider is misstatements that \\nlater translate into restatements. In Section IV.C.3.b.iii. above, we \\nestimated that the magnitude of the potential increase in Item 4.02 \\nrestatements represented -$5,000 in stock market impact per year per \\naffected issuer. Secondly, we estimated earlier in this section that \\nthe magnitude of the potential increase in fraud risk is about -$17,500 \\nin market capitalization per year per affected issuer, of which 25 \\npercent or about -$4,500 reflects the market adjusting to a more \\naccurate representation of issuers' financial situations.\\\\605\\\\ Summing \\nthese quantified effects, and rounding up, we estimate that there may \\nbe approximately $10,000 of pure transfers across shareholders per year \\nper affected issuer representing these corrections in stock values to \\nreflect issuers' actual financial positions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\605\\\\ We note that some portion of this correction may already \\nbe incorporated in our estimate with respect to restatements given \\nthat we do no separately consider restatements that are associated \\nwith specific charges or allegations versus other statements.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As discussed above, these estimates are intended to be responsive \\nto commenters who indicated that further quantitative analysis of the \\ncosts of the amendments would be appropriate. One commenter also \\nprovided alternative quantified estimates of the costs of expanding the \\nexemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement, estimating a \\n$1.7 million loss in future earnings and $2.2 million in forgone market \\nvalue per issuer.\\\\606\\\\ While we rely on evidence from the same \\nunderlying study that this commenter uses for some of our estimates, we \\ndo not rely on these specific estimates for two primary reasons. First, \\nthe underlying study indicates that these per issuer estimates apply \\nnot to all issuers but only to those issuers that are suspected of \\nmisreporting that their ICFR is effective when exempted from the ICFR \\nattestation requirement, which the study estimates to be only 9.3 \\npercent of the issuers.\\\\607\\\\ Secondly, these estimates reflect \\naggregate effects over three years and we scale everything to \\nannualized effects for better comparability.\\\\608\\\\ We also note that the \\nestimate described by the commenter as forgone market value is \\ndescribed in the underlying study as a delay in a market value decline \\nthat would otherwise happen currently, not as an increase in market \\ncapitalization that could be captured under the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement.\\\\609\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\606\\\\ See letter from Prof. Barth et al.\\n    \\\\607\\\\ See Ge et al. 2017 Study, note 393 above.\\n    \\\\608\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\609\\\\ Id. In particular, this study estimates a stock market \\nvalue correction that would be delayed until ICFR misreporters \\nexperience the negative consequences of ineffective ICFR (such as \\nrestatements or lower operating performance), rather than resulting \\nimmediately because of a disclosure of ineffective ICFR. The study \\nestimates that a $2.2 million stock market value correction would be \\ndelayed across a period of three years per suspected misreporter, \\nwho are estimated to represent 9.3 percent of the issuers exempt \\nfrom the ICFR auditor attestation requirement. Annualizing and \\ngeneralizing the study's estimate across issuers' results in an \\nestimated delayed stock market correction per year per affected \\nissuer of about $70,000 ($2.2 million divided by three years times \\n9.3 percent). We note that this estimate is similar to the likely \\nstock market impact of the quantified costs and transfers that we \\nestimate may result from the adverse effects of removing the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement for the affected issuers (such as \\nrestatements and lower operating performance). In particular, our \\nestimate of about $10,000 in potential transfers per year per \\naffected issuer represents a $10,000 potential stock market \\ncorrection per year per affected issuer. Our estimate of quantified \\npotential costs of about $60,000 per year per affected issuer would \\nlikely be reflected in a similarly-sized stock market reaction, for \\na further potential stock market correction of about $60,000 per \\nyear per affected issuer, and a total of about $70,000 ($10,000 plus \\n$60,000) in stock market effects per year per affected issuer, the \\nsame as the estimate implied by the study. That said, we differ \\nsomewhat in the attribution of this total to deadweight costs versus \\ntransfers, as the Ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above, suggests \\nthat the total estimated stock market effect may represent only a \\ndifference in timing of the effect and thus a transfer across \\nshareholders.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Another commenter \\\\610\\\\ cited the same underlying study's \\\\611\\\\ \\nestimates of quantified costs and benefits associated with the ICFR \\nauditor attestation. As discussed above, the study estimates, in \\naggregate and in present value terms, a total of $388 million in \\naggregate audit fee savings and a total of $719 million in lower \\nearnings associated with exempting non-accelerated filers.\\\\612\\\\ While \\nthe commenter did not suggest that we adopt those specific estimates, \\nwe note that we do not rely directly on those estimates, which apply to \\na different context. In particular, the estimates in that study are \\nintended to quantify the costs and benefits associated with the \\nexemption that applies to all existing non-accelerated filers, versus \\nthose associated with extending the exemption to the smaller number and \\ndifferent type of affected issuers discussed in this release. However, \\nas discussed in more detail throughout the release, we do rely on some \\nresults and approaches from that study in constructing our own \\nestimates.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\610\\\\ See letter from Prof. Ge et al.\\n    \\\\611\\\\ See Ge et al. 2017 Study, note 393 above.\\n    \\\\612\\\\ This study also estimates a delay over three years in the \\ntiming of a market value decline (that would otherwise have occurred \\nat the beginning of this three year period) of $935 million \\nassociated with the exemption from the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement. See Section IV.C.2.b.ii. above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nii. Discussion of Economic Costs\\n    While the previous section provided computations of monetary \\nestimates of certain potential adverse effects of the amendments, this \\nsection provides further discussion of those costs as well as other \\neconomic costs that we are unable to quantify. Per the discussion in \\nSection IV.C.3.a. above, any impact of the amendments on the \\neffectiveness of ICFR and the reliability of financial statements may \\nhave issuer-level implications as well as market-level implications. At \\nthe issuer level, the potential increase, on average, in the rate of \\nineffective ICFR and restatements may lead investors to charge a \\nsomewhat higher average cost of capital for the affected issuers. An \\nissuer's cost of capital, or the expected return that investors demand \\nto hold its securities, determines the price at which it can raise \\nfunds. Thus, any such increase may be associated with a reduction in\\n\\n[[Page 17231]]\\n\\ncapital formation to the extent that it decreases the rate at which the \\naffected issuers raise new capital towards new investments. Further, \\nthe affected issuers may also experience reduced operational efficiency \\nbecause of the reduced reliability of financial information available \\nto management for the purpose of making operating decisions. These \\npotential effects are supported by a number of studies discussed \\nabove.\\\\613\\\\ Finally, there may be legal and reputational costs \\nassociated with any increase in the risk of fraud, which would \\nrepresent deadweight losses, or net costs to society.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\613\\\\ See Section IV.C.3.a. above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Several commenters expressed the view that eliminating the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement would increase the cost of capital for \\ncertain issuers because of the potential effects of this change on the \\nreliability of the financial statements of the affected issuers.\\\\614\\\\ \\nThe potential issuer-level effect on the cost of capital is difficult \\nto confirm and to quantify for the affected issuers because the \\nexisting studies may not be generalizable to the affected issuers and \\nto the current nature of ICFR auditor attestations (i.e., after the \\n2007 change in the ICFR auditing standard, the 2010 change in risk \\nassessment auditing standards, and recent PCAOB inspections focused on \\nthese aspects of audits). Further, some of these studies provide mixed \\nevidence, as discussed in Section IV.C.3.a. above. Moreover, the \\nmethods used in previous studies are difficult to apply to a comparable \\nsample of low-revenue issuers in more recent years because, for \\nexample, there would only be a small sample of such issuers that \\nrecently switched filing status and because methods of measuring the \\nimplied cost of capital are particularly problematic for such \\nissuers.\\\\615\\\\ Commenters did not provide us with estimates or data that \\ncould be used to estimate potential effects on the cost of capital.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\614\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BDO and CFA.\\n    \\\\615\\\\ See note 481 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The available evidence supports the qualitative, directional \\neffects on cost of capital noted above. That is, some of the affected \\nissuers could experience an increase in their cost of capital. However, \\nthe previous section demonstrated that the potential increase in \\nmaterial weaknesses in ICFR that we estimate could occur may translate \\ninto a more limited effect on the reliability of disclosures, as \\nmeasured, for example, by the rate of restatements, for the affected \\nissuers. Also, based on our analysis, the financial metrics of these \\nissuers have lower explanatory power for investors' determination of \\ntheir value than in the case of other issuers. These two factors may \\nmitigate the potential adverse effects on the affected issuers' cost of \\ncapital.\\n    In addition, some of the costs of extending the exemption from the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement to additional issuers may be \\nfurther mitigated by the fact that some issuers, even if exempted, may \\nvoluntarily choose to bear the costs of obtaining such an \\nattestation.\\\\616\\\\ Affected issuers that expect a lower cost of capital \\nwith an ICFR auditor attestation, such as those with effective \\nICFR,\\\\617\\\\ and particularly those that will be raising new debt or \\nequity capital,\\\\618\\\\ are more likely to voluntarily obtain an ICFR \\nauditor attestation. We note that low-revenue issuers have less access \\nto internally-generated capital, as discussed above, so they may be \\nmore reliant on external financing for capital. Consistent with this \\nargument, commenters suggested that issuers may voluntarily obtain an \\nICFR auditor attestation if it were demanded by investors,\\\\619\\\\ not \\ncomplying would have a negative impact on investment analysts' \\ncoverage,\\\\620\\\\ or issuers deem it a good use of their capital \\nresources.\\\\621\\\\ Further, as discussed in Section IV.C.4.d. below, we \\nnote that the benefits and therefore likelihood of voluntarily \\nobtaining ICFR auditor attestations may be increased by the new check-\\nbox disclosure on annual reports required by the amendments, in that \\ninvestors should be more able to readily discern which issuers obtained \\nan ICFR auditor attestation.\\\\622\\\\ However, it is probably not the case \\nthat issuers would voluntarily obtain an ICFR auditor attestation in \\nevery case in which the total benefits of doing so would exceed the \\ntotal costs.\\\\623\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\616\\\\ Studies have associated voluntary compliance with the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement with decreased cost of capital and \\nvalue enhancements. See, e.g., Cory Cassell, Linda Myers, & Jian \\nZhou, The Effect of Voluntary Internal Control Audits on the Cost of \\nCapital, Working Paper (2013) (Cassell et al. 2013 Study), available \\nat \\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734300\\n; Todd \\nKravet, Sarah McVay, & David Weber, Costs and Benefits of Internal \\nControl Audits: Evidence from M&A Transactions, Rev. of Acct. Stud. \\n(forthcoming 2018), available at \\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2958318\\n; and Carnes et al. 2019 Study, note \\n397 above. We note that the latter two studies are not able to \\ndifferentiate between the effects of the ICFR auditor attestation \\nand of management's assessment of ICFR under SOX Section 404(a).\\n    \\\\617\\\\ See Brown et al. 2016 Study, note 396 above.\\n    \\\\618\\\\ See Cassell et al. 2013 Study, note 616 above.\\n    \\\\619\\\\ See, e.g., letters from BIO and Guaranty.\\n    \\\\620\\\\ See, e.g., letter from Guaranty.\\n    \\\\621\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\622\\\\ See 2013 GAO Study, note 246 above.\\n    \\\\623\\\\ There is substantial literature describing the fact that \\nin certain circumstances the incentives of managers are not \\nperfectly aligned with those of shareholders. See, e.g., Michael \\nJensen & William Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, \\nAgency Costs and Ownership Structure, 3(4) J. of Fin. Econ. 305 \\n(1976). Also, as discussed in Section IV.C.3.a. above, the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement can have important market-level \\nbenefits through network and spillover effects that issuers are \\nunlikely to internalize. That is, issuers are likely to balance the \\nissuer-level benefits against the issuer-level costs of voluntary \\ncompliance without considering these externalities.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The available evidence also supports the qualitative, directional \\neffects on operating performance noted above. That is, some of the \\naffected issuers could experience lower operating performance due to \\nreliance on less reliable financial statements in their decision-\\nmaking. Like the potential effects on the cost of capital, the \\npotential effect on issuer operating performance associated with \\nreported ineffective ICFR is also difficult to estimate and is likely \\nto be mitigated by the multiple factors discussed above. Further, the \\npoint estimates in one study demonstrate that issuers that remediate \\ntheir reported material weaknesses in ICFR might be able to make up a \\nsubstantial amount of the previous operating underperformance.\\\\624\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\624\\\\ See Feng et al. 2015 Study, note 484 above, (with point \\nestimates of a one percent reduction in ROA in years with material \\nweaknesses in ICFR and a 2.6 percent increase in ROA upon \\nremediation, though there is significant uncertainty around these \\nrates).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We do, however, quantify potential effects on operating performance \\nassociated with ICFR misreporting, which are less likely to be \\ncorrected by remediation because the underlying material weaknesses are \\nlikely undetected. We also estimate potential deadweight losses (e.g., \\nlegal and reputational costs) associated with a possible increase in \\nthe risk of fraud. In total, per Section IV.C.3.d.i. above, we estimate \\npotential issuer-level costs of $48,000 in reduced earnings plus \\n$13,000 in losses related to the increased risk of fraud, or roughly \\n$60,000 in costs per year on average per affected issuer, though we \\nview this estimate as conservative because it does not fully account \\nfor the mitigating factors specific to low-revenue issuers discussed \\nabove.\\n    We note that issuers and other market participants may adapt to the \\nproposed changes in various ways, which may serve to enhance or \\nmitigate the anticipated issuer-level costs. However, these actions, \\nand therefore their net effects, are difficult to predict. For\\n\\n[[Page 17232]]\\n\\nexample, it has been posited that issuers reacted to the requirements \\nof SOX by reducing accruals-based earnings management and, in its \\nstead, making suboptimal business decisions for the purpose of real \\nearnings management.\\\\625\\\\ It is therefore possible that newly exempt \\nissuers could, to some extent, reduce real earnings management in favor \\nof accruals-based management. Another possibility is that scrutiny from \\nanalysts may provide an alternative source of discipline for some of \\nthe affected issuers, although there is evidence that analysts may stop \\ncovering issuers whose financial statements are deemed to have become \\nless reliable.\\\\626\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\625\\\\ See Daniel Cohen, Aiyesha Dey, & Thomas Lys, Real and \\nAccrual-Based Earnings Management in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes \\nOxley Periods, 83(3) Acct. Rev. 757 (2008) (finding that an increase \\nin real earnings management partially offset the decrease in \\naccruals-based earnings management that followed SOX).

For \\nexample, the effects may vary based on issuers' proclivity to detect \\nand disclose material weaknesses in ICFR in the absence of an ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement and whether the issuers' have \\ncharacteristics that the market associates with having such material \\nweaknesses. We discuss this variation in detail in the Proposing \\nRelease.\\\\627\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\627\\\\ See Section III.C.4.c. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We next consider effects at the market-level. Some of these effects \\nare associated with the transfers across shareholders that we estimated \\nin Section IV.C.3.d.i. above. In total, we estimated that there may be \\napproximately $10,000 of pure transfers across shareholders per year \\nper affected issuer representing corrections in stock values to reflect \\nissuers' actual financial positions. These transfers and the associated \\nmispricing may reduce the efficient allocation of capital at the market \\nlevel. Further, to the extent that the reliability of financial \\nstatements is somewhat reduced on average at the issuer level for the \\naffected issuers, the efficient allocation of capital at the market \\nlevel may be negatively affected given a diminished ability to reliably \\nevaluate different investment alternatives.\\\\628\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\628\\\\ The efficient allocation of capital may be further reduced \\nto the extent that the potential cost of capital effects discussed \\nabove operate through a reduction in the liquidity of the market for \\nthese issuers' shares, which increases the costs to investors \\nlooking to adjust their investments or redeploy their capital. See \\nDiamond and Verrecchia 1991 Study, note 477 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The reduced reliability of financial statements could also \\nnegatively impact capital formation through a reduction in investor \\nconfidence. Several commenters noted that they expected the amendments \\nto have a negative effect on investor confidence.\\\\629\\\\ In contrast, one \\ncommenter asserted that there is no correlation between a smaller \\ncompany's compliance with the ICFR auditor attestation requirement and \\nstronger markets in general,\\\\630\\\\ while two others noted that they did \\nnot expect effects on investor confidence with respect to affected \\nissuers that are banks.\\\\631\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\629\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Better Markets and CII.\\n    \\\\630\\\\ See letter from BIO.\\n    \\\\631\\\\ See letters from BSC and SCBA.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Section IV.C.3.a. provides additional discussion of these market-\\nlevel factors. While we are unable to directly quantify the market-\\nlevel effects on the efficient allocation of capital and on investor \\nconfidence, we anticipate that these effects may be limited due to the \\nsize of the expected effect on the reliability of these issuers' \\ndisclosures and potential transfers across shareholders as well as the \\nsmall percentage of the total value of traded securities that is \\nrepresented by the affected issuers. In particular, we estimate that \\nthe affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirements represent 0.2 percent of the total equity \\nmarket capitalization of issuers.\\\\632\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\632\\\\ This statistic is based on staff analysis of data from \\nCompustat. The total population of issuers used to construct this \\nestimate are those that have annual reports on Forms 10-K, 20-F, or \\n40-F in calendar year 2018 and data on market capitalization in \\nCompustat. See above note 336 for detail on the identification of \\naffected issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n4. Potential Benefits and Costs Related to Other Aspects of the \\nAmendments\\n    In this section we consider the potential effects of the amendments \\nwith regard to other implications of accelerated filer status, \\nspecifically with respect to the timing of filing deadlines, certain \\nrequired disclosures, and the determination of filer status. We also \\nconsider below some incremental effects of the amendments to the \\nthresholds for exiting accelerated and large accelerated filer status \\nand the new check-box disclosure required on the cover page of annual \\nreports on Form 10-K, 20-F, or 40-F.\\na. Filing Deadlines\\n    As discussed in Section IV.B.1. above, non-accelerated filers are \\npermitted an additional 15 days and five days, respectively, beyond the \\ndeadlines that apply to accelerated filers, to file their annual and \\nquarterly reports. Extending these later deadlines to the affected \\nissuers may provide these issuers with additional flexibility in \\npreparing their disclosures, while modestly decreasing the timeliness \\nof the data for investors.\\n    Table 6 in Section IV.B.3. demonstrates that while the filing \\ndeadlines are not a binding constraint for most accelerated filers, \\nwith 63 percent filing their annual reports over five days early in \\nrecent years, some accelerated filers are likely to benefit from the \\nextended deadline. For example, filing Form NT automatically provides a \\ngrace period of an additional 15 days to file an annual report, and \\nover the past four years, about four percent of accelerated filers \\nfiled their annual reports within this grace period rather than by the \\noriginal deadline. A further five percent of accelerated filers filed \\ntheir annual reports after these additional 15 days had passed.\\n    Even affected issuers that would otherwise have filed by the \\naccelerated filer deadline may avail themselves of the additional time \\nprovided under the amendments to balance other obligations or to \\nprepare higher quality disclosures. The 2003 acceleration of filing \\ndeadlines for accelerated filers from 90 to 75 days was associated, at \\nleast initially, with a higher rate of restatements for the affected \\nissuers.\\\\633\\\\ This finding suggests that a later deadline may allow \\nsome issuers to provide more reliable financial disclosures. While \\nthese issuers could alternatively file Form NT to receive an automatic \\nextension, studies have found that investors interpret such filings as \\na negative signal, resulting in a negative stock price reaction.\\\\634\\\\ \\nIssuers may thus\\n\\n[[Page 17233]]\\n\\nprefer to meet the original deadline if possible.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\633\\\\ See, e.g., Colleen Boland, Scott Bronson, & Chris Hogan, \\nAccelerated Filing Deadlines, Internal Controls, and Financial \\nStatement Quality: The Case of Originating Misstatements, 29(3) \\nAcct.

Horizons 109 \\n(2017).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    On the other hand, allowing the affected issuers to file according \\nto the later non-accelerated filer deadlines may reduce the timeliness \\nand therefore usefulness of the disclosures to investors. Studies have \\nfound a reduction in the market reaction to disclosure when the \\nreporting lag between the end of the period in question and the \\ndisclosure date is lengthy, as more of the information becomes \\navailable through other public channels.\\\\635\\\\ Researchers have also \\nquestioned whether such lags increase information asymmetries, because \\nsome investors are more able to access or process information that \\ncould provide indirect insight into an issuer's financial status or \\nperformance through alternative channels.\\\\636\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\635\\\\ See, e.g., Dan Givoly & Dan Palmon, Timeliness of Annual \\nEarnings Announcements: Some Empirical Evidence, 57(3) Acct.

Disclosures Required of Accelerated Filers\\n    Non-accelerated filers are not required to provide disclosure \\nregarding the availability of their filings under Item 101(e)(4) of \\nRegulation S-K. While some investors may benefit from reduced search \\ncosts due to such disclosures, we do not expect that extending the \\nexemption from these disclosures to the affected issuers will have \\nsignificant economic effects.\\n    Non-accelerated filers also are not required to provide disclosure \\nrequired by Item 1B of Form 10-K or Item 4A of Form 20-F about \\nunresolved staff comments on their periodic and/or current reports. \\nStudies have found that the eventual disclosure of staff comments and \\nrelated correspondence, as well as interim information about these \\ncomments before they are made public, are value-relevant (in that they \\naffect the pricing of securities) for investors.\\\\641\\\\ While our \\nunderstanding is that Items 1B and 4A disclosures are relatively \\nuncommon,\\\\642\\\\ extending the exemption from the requirement to disclose \\nunresolved staff comments to the affected issuers may, in some \\ncircumstances, prevent the timely disclosure of value-relevant \\ninformation to public market investors. Moreover, because Item 1B of \\nForm 10-K and Item 4A of Form 20-F requires unresolved staff comments \\nto be disclosed if they were made not less than 180 days prior to the \\nend of that fiscal year, issuers no longer subject to this disclosure \\nrequirement may have a reduced incentive to resolve comments in a \\ntimely manner, which could decrease the quality of reporting for the \\nperiod over which comments continue to be unresolved. We did not \\nreceive any comments on these potential effects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\641\\\\ See, e.g., Patricia Dechow, Alastair Lawrence, & James \\nRyans, SEC Comment Letters and Insider Sales, 91(2) Acct.

Transition Thresholds\\n    The amendments include revisions to the transition thresholds that \\naddress when an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer can \\ntransition into a different filer status. The amendments will allow \\naccelerated or large accelerated filers to become non-accelerated \\nfilers if they qualify under the SRC revenue test or meet a revised \\npublic float transition threshold. An issuer whose revenues previously \\nexceeded the SRC initial revenue threshold of $100 million will not \\nqualify under the SRC revenue test unless its revenues fall below $80 \\nmillion. The $80 million transition threshold for the SRC revenue test \\nis 80 percent of the initial threshold of $100 million in revenue. An \\nissuer whose public float previously exceeded the $75 million initial \\nthreshold for accelerated filer status will become a non-accelerated \\nfiler if its public float falls below $60 million, or 80 percent of \\nthat initial threshold, as opposed to the current threshold of $50 \\nmillion. Finally, the amendments also revise the public float \\ntransition threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status and \\nbecoming an accelerated filer from $500 million to $560 million in \\npublic float, or 80 percent of the $700 million entry threshold, to \\nalign with the transition threshold for entering SRC status after \\nhaving exceeded $700 million in public float.\\n    The filer type exit thresholds in Rule 12b-2 are set below the \\ncorresponding entry thresholds to provide some stability in issuer \\nclassification given normal variation in public float and revenues. The \\nexact placement of these thresholds involves a tradeoff between the \\ndegree of volatility in classification versus the extent to which the \\ncategories persistently include issuers that are below the initial \\nentry thresholds. The Proposing Release presented a quantitative \\nanalysis of this tradeoff using 20 years of data on the evolution of \\nmarket capitalizations (as a proxy for public float) and revenues.\\\\643\\\\ \\nIn particular, this analysis demonstrated that a higher exit threshold \\nis associated with more volatility in classification. For example, exit \\nthresholds set at 100 percent of the public float entry thresholds \\nwould have led eight to ten percent of new entrants into a filer status \\nto immediately exit the following year and then re-enter once again the \\nyear after that. Issuers and investors may be confused as a result of \\nsuch frequent fluctuations in filer type. They may also bear resulting \\ncosts, such as (for issuers) the cost of frequently revising their \\ndisclosure schedules and continually considering the impact of whether \\nthey are subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement from one \\nyear to the next and (for investors) any incremental cost of evaluating \\nthe\\n\\n[[Page 17234]]\\n\\nreliability of financial disclosures for an issuer that is not \\nconsistently subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\643\\\\ See Table 16 of the Proposing Release, note 4 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    On the other hand, the analysis in the Proposing Release also \\nillustrated that a lower exit threshold is associated with a greater \\nnumber of issuers remaining in a particular category despite falling \\nbelow the entry threshold. For example, exit thresholds set at 60 \\npercent of the public float entry thresholds would have prevented four \\nto six percent of the new entrants into a filer status from exiting \\nthat status despite being below the entry threshold in the next two \\nyears. A low exit threshold can thus risk having a filer status \\neffectively apply to a broader group of issuers than intended.\\n    The analysis in the Proposing Release further demonstrated that the \\nbalance between limiting filer status volatility while enabling filer \\nstatus mobility provided by an exit threshold of 80 percent is similar \\naround a $250 million, $75 million, and $700 million market \\ncapitalization. In particular, while five to six percent of the new \\nentrants into a filer status would be expected to transition out and \\nback into the status in the following two years, one to two percent of \\nthose entrants would be expected to remain within the same filer status \\ndespite being below the entry threshold for the two following years. We \\ntherefore expect the increase in the public float thresholds to exit \\naccelerated and large accelerated filer status to $60 and $560 million, \\nor 80 percent of the entry threshold in each case, to lead to a similar \\ntradeoff in these factors as the 80 percent public float threshold to \\nre-enter SRC status.\\n    One commenter noted that certain of the affected issuers may \\nrecognize revenues unevenly across periods due to certain collaborative \\narrangements.\\\\644\\\\ When considering issuers that have empirically \\ncrossed a $100 million revenue entry threshold in the past, the \\nanalysis in the Proposing Release demonstrated that, on average, these \\nissuers would not be subject to significant volatility in \\nclassification. Thus, while some issuers may be subject to such \\nvolatility,\\\\645\\\\ this does not appear to be a widespread concern. In \\nfact, the analysis in the Proposing Release demonstrated that revenue \\nis on average more stable than market capitalization, so the 80 percent \\nthreshold in the revenue test for exiting accelerated and large \\naccelerated filer status is expected to provide a lower degree of filer \\nstatus fluctuations for a comparable degree of filer status mobility. \\nOverall, we expect the amended transition thresholds to provide a \\ntradeoff between filer status mobility and volatility that is \\nconsistent with the tradeoff provided by the recently revised SRC \\ntransition provisions.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\644\\\\ See letter from EY.\\n    \\\\645\\\\ Issuers that expect significant volatility in their \\nclassification could consider voluntarily obtaining an ICFR auditor \\nattestation in years where one is not required, given that \\ncommenters suggested that there would be no significant cost savings \\nfrom obtaining an ICFR auditor attestation every three years as \\nopposed to annually. See, e.g., letters from Crowe and KPMG.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nd. Disclosure\\n    The amendments add a check box to the cover pages of Forms 10-K, \\n20-F, and 40-F to indicate whether an ICFR auditor attestation is \\nincluded in the filing. While filer status is reported prominently on \\nthe cover page of annual reports for most issuers, there is currently \\nnot similarly prominent disclosure of whether an ICFR auditor \\nattestation is provided. Such disclosure has been recommended by the \\nGAO,\\\\646\\\\ as well as some commenters.\\\\647\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\646\\\\ See 2013 GAO Study, note 246 above.\\n    \\\\647\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ, CFA Inst., CII, Grant \\nThornton, and KPMG.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Investors can already ascertain whether an ICFR auditor attestation \\nis included by searching within an issuer's annual report, and \\nincluding additional items on the annual report cover page could \\nmarginally decrease the salience of each item already reported there. \\nHowever, several commenters noted that it is currently difficult for \\ninvestors to easily determine whether an issuer's filing includes an \\nICFR auditor attestation.\\\\648\\\\ The cover page check box disclosure \\nrequirement will make it easier for investors to identify issuers that \\nundergo an ICFR auditor attestation with only minimal additional \\ndisclosure expense for registrants. This may, on the margin, increase \\nthe efficiency of investment decisions and the allocation of capital \\nacross the market. It may also enhance the value to issuers of pursuing \\nan ICFR auditor attestation, even when one is not required, by making \\nit more likely that investors recognize that an issuer has obtained an \\nICFR auditor attestation and therefore account for this factor in their \\ninvestment decisions. While issuers that voluntarily obtain an ICFR \\nauditor attestation would bear additional costs to do so, we expect \\nthey would voluntarily bear these costs only if they believe that the \\nassociated issuer-level benefits (e.g., a reduced cost of capital) \\nwould more than offset those costs. Thus, to the extent that more \\nprominent disclosure would enhance these benefits, it may be a positive \\nfactor in the decision of additional firms to voluntarily obtain an \\nICFR auditor attestation. Such voluntary action by some of the issuers \\nfor which the requirement will be eliminated could, as discussed above, \\nmitigate some of the potential negative effects of the amendments, \\nalthough it is difficult to predict the frequency with which voluntary \\ncompliance might occur.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\648\\\\ See, e.g., letters from CAQ, CFA Inst., and Grant \\nThornton. See also 2013 GAO Study, note 246 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n5. Alternatives to the Amendments\\n    Below we consider the relative costs and benefits of reasonable \\nalternatives to the implementation choices in the amendments.\\na. Exclude All SRCs From Accelerated Filer Category\\n    We considered excluding all SRCs from the accelerated filer \\ndefinition, consistent with the past alignment of the SRC and non-\\naccelerated filer categories. This alternative would include SRCs that \\nmeet the revenue test, as under the adopted amendments, as well as \\nthose that have a public float of less than $250 million when initially \\ndetermining SRC status. Several commenters supported this \\napproach.\\\\649\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\649\\\\ See, e.g., letters from ASA, Guaranty, NAM, and Nasdaq.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    This alternative would have several benefits, such as promoting \\nregulatory simplicity and reducing any frictions or confusion caused by \\nissuers having to make multiple determinations of their filer type. \\nThis alternative would also expand the benefits of the amendments to \\nadditional issuers. We estimate that 268 additional issuers \\\\650\\\\ would \\nbe non-accelerated filers rather than accelerated filers under this \\nalternative, of which 48 are EGCs and 220 would newly be exempt from \\nthe ICFR auditor attestation requirement under SOX Section 404(b) \\n(although we estimate that six of these newly exempt filers would still \\nbe subject to the FDIC auditor attestation requirement). In the\\n\\n[[Page 17235]]\\n\\nProposing Release,\\\\651\\\\ we performed an analysis of the audit fees of \\nlower-float issuers of different types and estimated an average \\ncompliance cost savings of $415,000 per year for the additional issuers \\nthat would be affected under this alternative, with some of these \\nissuers experiencing lesser or greater savings. This likely represents \\na significant cost savings for issuers with less than $250 million in \\npublic float and may thus have beneficial economic effects on \\ncompetition and capital formation. As discussed above, smaller issuers \\ngenerally bear proportionately higher compliance costs than larger \\nissuers. Reducing these additional issuers' costs would reduce their \\noverhead expenses and may enhance their ability to compete with larger \\nissuers. To the extent that the cost savings for the additional \\naffected issuers enable capital investments that would not otherwise be \\nmade, this alternative would also lead to additional benefits in \\ncapital formation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\650\\\\ This estimate is based on staff analysis of the number of \\naccelerated filers in 2018 with public float of at least $60 million \\nbut less than $250 million and prior fiscal year revenues (or, in \\nthe case of BDCs, investment income) of at least $100 million and \\nthat are eligible to be SRCs (i.e., excluding ABS issuers, RICs, \\nBDCs, subsidiaries of non-SRCs, and FPIs filing on foreign forms or \\nusing IFRS) or are BDCs (though we estimate that there are no BDCs \\nthat meet these criteria). Revenue data is sourced from XBRL \\nfilings, Compustat, and Calcbench. See note 298 above for details on \\nthe identification of the population of accelerated filers. We note \\nthat the incremental number of affected issuers could be higher than \\nthis estimate because there are approximately 65 issuers for which \\nfiler status and/or public float data are not available (and revenue \\ndata is either unavailable or revenues are at least $100 million).\\n    \\\\651\\\\ See Section III.C.6.a. of the Proposing Release, note 4 \\nabove.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    However, we expect the costs of this alternative to be greater than \\nfor the amendments, primarily due to the broader application of the \\nexemption from the ICFR auditor attestation requirement and the \\ndiminished impact of some of the mitigating factors discussed in \\nSection IV.C.3. above on SRCs that meet the public float test rather \\nthan the revenue test. In particular, we estimated in the Proposing \\nRelease \\\\652\\\\ that extending the exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement to issuers that are eligible to be SRCs based \\non their public float may result in an average increase in the rate of \\nineffective ICFR of about 25 percentage points among these issuers, \\nsomewhat higher than our estimate for low-revenue issuers. The analysis \\nin the Proposing Release \\\\653\\\\ also demonstrated that low public float \\nissuers restate their financial statements at rates comparable to \\nhigher public float issuers, unlike low-revenue issuers, whose \\nrestatement rates were three to nine percentage points lower than for \\nhigher-revenue issuers of the same filer status. We therefore believe \\nthat the proposition that low-revenue issuers may, on average, be less \\nsusceptible to certain kinds of misstatements may not apply to the same \\nextent to issuers with low public float. We estimated in the Proposing \\nRelease that the increase in restatement rates for the additional \\naffected issuers may be comparable to the two percentage points we \\nestimated for low-revenue issuers, but that, in contrast to the results \\nfor low-revenue issuers, this would likely result in higher restatement \\nrates for the additional affected issuers than for the higher public \\nfloat issuers that would remain accelerated filers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\652\\\\ Id.\\n    \\\\653\\\\ Id.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The Proposing Release also tested whether the potential adverse \\nimpact of such a change may be mitigated by a lower empirical relevance \\nof financial statements for the market valuation of these issuers. \\nHowever, we did not find evidence that the market relies on financial \\nstatements to a lesser extent for the valuation of issuers with public \\nfloat less than $250 million (as compared to issuers with a larger \\npublic float), and so this further mitigating factor that applies to \\nlow-revenue issuers likely does not apply equally to lower public float \\nissuers.\\n    Finally, as in Section IV.C.3., we re-examined responses to the \\n2008-09 Survey. When asked about the net benefits of complying with SOX \\nSection 404, 16 percent of respondents at accelerated filers with \\npublic float of less than $250 million claimed that the costs far \\noutweighed the benefits, in contrast to, as reported above, 30 percent \\nof respondents at accelerated filers with revenues of less than $100 \\nmillion.\\\\654\\\\ While this survey data is somewhat dated, it provides an \\nindication as to the perception by executives at issuers at that time \\nof the relative costs and benefits of the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement. To the extent that this perception is borne out by the \\nactual costs and benefits of the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nfor issuers that meet the SRC revenue test and for those that would \\notherwise be SRCs under the public float test, this data may suggest \\nthat low-revenue issuers would benefit more from qualifying as non-\\naccelerated filers than would other types of SRCs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\654\\\\ These estimates are based on staff analysis of data from \\nthe 2008-09 Survey. The analysis considers responses pertaining to \\nthe most recent year for which a given respondent provided a \\nresponse. We note that the rate of responses to the question about \\nnet benefits was lower than for other questions. See 2009 SEC Staff \\nStudy, note 304 above, and Alexander et al. 2013 Study, note 401 \\nabove, for details on the survey and analysis methodology.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We did not receive any comments on our analysis of the benefits and \\ncosts of extending non-accelerated filer status to all SRCs.\\nb. Include or Exclude Certain Issuer Types\\n    Alternatively, we considered approaches that would include or \\nexclude additional issuer types, or apply different requirements to \\nparticular issuer types. For example, we could extend non-accelerated \\nfiler status to other issuers with between $75 million and $700 million \\nin public float that meet the SRC revenue test but would not be \\neligible to be SRCs because they are majority-owned subsidiaries of \\nnon-SRCs. However, in the Proposing Release, we estimated that only one \\nmajority-owned subsidiary of a non-SRC parent would meet the same \\npublic float and revenue thresholds as the affected issuers. Given the \\nminimal number of such issuers and the responsibilities of the parent \\nof any such issuers with respect to the ICFR of their subsidiaries, we \\nexpect the incremental costs and benefits of this alternative to be \\nminimal.\\n    As discussed above, in a change from the proposal, the final \\namendments also exclude BDCs from the accelerated and large accelerated \\nfiler definitions under circumstances that are analogous to the \\nexclusions for other issuers under the amendments. We estimate that \\napproximately 28 BDCs will therefore be affected by the amendments, of \\nwhich seven are EGCs and therefore already exempt from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement.\\n    We recognize, as stated in the Proposing Release, that investors in \\nBDCs generally may place greater significance on the financial \\nreporting of BDCs relative to low-revenue non-investment company \\nissuers. However, given the small number of BDCs, it is difficult to \\nassess to what extent our findings with respect to the anticipated \\ncosts and benefits of the amendments for the broader pool of affected \\nissuers would apply similarly to BDCs as an isolated subset of these \\nissuers.\\\\655\\\\ We note, however, that one commenter urged that we pursue \\nthe adopted approach, stating that, among other reasons, ``[a]llowing \\nsmaller BDCs to benefit from non-accelerated filer status, and thereby \\nease regulatory costs and burdens, could encourage more BDCs to enter \\nthe public markets, creating greater access to capital for small \\noperating companies and expanding investment opportunities for retail \\ninvestors.''.\\\\656\\\\ Given the limited\\n\\n[[Page 17236]]\\n\\nnumber of affected issuers that are BDCs, we preliminarily expect the \\naggregate incremental costs and benefits of this alternative relative \\nto the adopted approach to be modest, as compared to the universe of \\nForm 10-K filers, although they could be significant for any particular \\nissuer and significant for traded BDCs as a class of Form 10-K filers \\nas we estimate the total number of traded BDC filers to be 51 (of which \\nseven have a market capitalization below $75 million and would be \\nalready considered non-accelerated filers).\\\\657\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\655\\\\ While more refined analysis is difficult, we note that, \\nfor the 54 to 75 BDCs for which a management report on ICFR is \\navailable in Audit Analytics for years 2014 through 2017, the rate \\nof ineffective ICFR reported by management is 9.0 percent, the rate \\nof restatements is 9.8 percent, and the rate of Item 4.02 \\nrestatements is 2.3 percent on average across these years, which are \\ncomparable to the corresponding rates for all accelerated filers \\nother than EGCs under the baseline. See Section IV.B.4. above.\\n    \\\\656\\\\ See letter from Proskauer.\\n    \\\\657\\\\ Nontraded BDCs also file on Form 10-K, but these issuers \\nare already non-accelerated filers because they do not have public \\nfloat.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We also considered alternative thresholds for BDCs, given that BDCs \\ndo not report revenue on their financial statements. The amendments \\nexclude a BDC from the accelerated and large accelerated filer \\ndefinitions in Rule 12b-2 if the BDC: (1) Has a public float of $75 \\nmillion or more, but less than $700 million; and (2) has investment \\nincome of less than $100 million. Table 16 below provides statistics \\nfrom the Proposing Release on other income-related metrics for BDCs \\nwith between $70 million and $700 million in public float.\\\\658\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\658\\\\ This analysis used market capitalization valuations as of \\nFebruary 2019 to determine the set of potentially affected BDCs \\nunder different alternatives. While this methodology is different \\nthan the approach used by Rule 12b-2, which uses the aggregate \\nworldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity \\nheld by non-affiliates as of the last business day of the issuer's \\nmost recent second fiscal quarter, we do not believe that it would \\nsubstantially change our analysis. This analysis did not remove BDCs \\nwho may qualify as non-accelerated filers based on their status as \\nEGCs. After identifying the set of potentially affected BDCs, our \\nstaff manually reviewed the then-most recent Form 10-K filed on our \\nEDGAR system for each BDC. The affected parties estimates in Section \\nIV.C.1. above uses self-identified filer status to identify affected \\nBDCs (as well as other affected issuers), rather than using market \\ncapitalization data for this purpose. In particular, current status \\nas an accelerated filer implies that the issuer's Rule 12b-2 public \\nfloat does not exceed $700 million. See above note 336. Also, the \\npublic float of the affected BDCs was manually collected for the \\npurpose of related statistics in Section IV.C.1.

Of the 29 BDCs \\nidentified in the Proposing Release with a market capitalization \\nbetween $75 million and $700 million, 28 had investment income of below \\n$100 million and 26 had investment income of below $80 million. We \\ntherefore anticipate that the incremental costs and benefits of a \\nthreshold of $80 million in investment income as compared to the \\nadopted threshold of $100 million in investment income would be \\nlimited.\\n    We also considered whether to require or permit BDCs to provide an \\nindependent public accountant's report on internal controls, similar to \\nthe one required by RICs on Form N-CEN, since both RICs and BDCs \\nprepare financial statements under Article 6 of Regulation S-X, in \\nplace of the auditor attestation required by SOX Section 404(b). We \\nconsidered whether such a substitution should be permitted for all BDCs \\nor only required for those BDCs that would no longer be required to \\nprovide a report under SOX Section 404(b). We do not have any data and \\ndid not receive any public comment, however, regarding the potential \\nbenefits and costs of using a Form N-CEN-type report on internal \\ncontrols as compared to the auditor attestation required by SOX Section \\n404(b).\\n    We also considered excluding all FPIs, which are included in the \\naffected issuers to the extent that they meet the required thresholds \\nand other qualifications, from the amendments. Researchers have found \\nthat the restatement rates of foreign issuers may be artificially \\ndepressed due to a lower likelihood of detection and disclosure of \\nmisstatements for these issuers.\\\\659\\\\ It is therefore possible that \\nencouraging more effective ICFR through an ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement may be particularly important for such issuers. On the \\nother hand, because low-revenue FPIs may have similar characteristics \\nto low-revenue domestic issuers, including them in the group of \\naffected issuers may help to maintain an even playing field for \\ncompetition amongst these issuers and avoid discouraging foreign \\ncompanies from issuing securities in U.S. public markets. The \\namendments attempt to strike a balance between these considerations by \\nallowing FPIs to avail themselves of the amendments only if they file \\non domestic forms and present their financial statements pursuant to \\nU.S. GAAP, as well as meeting the required thresholds and other \\nqualifications.\\\\660\\\\ Because of limitations in the availability of data \\nsuch as filing status or public float for many FPIs, we are unable to \\nreliably measure the potential effects for this subset of issuers. \\nCommenters did not provide data that would allow us to further analyze \\nthe potential effects for these issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\659\\\\ See, e.g., Suraj Srinivasan, Aida Sijamic Wahid, & Gwen \\nYu, Admitting Mistakes: Home Country Effect on the Reliability of \\nRestatement Reporting, 90(3) Acct. Rev. 1201 (2015).\\n    \\\\660\\\\ While we currently estimate that no FPIs would currently \\nqualify based on these requirements, we note that there are FPIs \\nthat otherwise meet the required thresholds and other qualifications \\nand that might choose to file on domestic forms using U.S. GAAP in \\norder to benefit from the amendments as well as the scaled \\ndisclosure accommodations available to SRCs if these benefits \\noutweigh the costs of changing their disclosure regime.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nc. Alternative Threshold\\n    We considered alternative levels at which a revenue threshold could \\nbe set. A $100 million dollar revenue threshold\\n\\n[[Page 17237]]\\n\\nwas recommended, in conjunction with a public float threshold, for the \\naccelerated filer definition as well as the SRC definition by the 2017 \\nSmall Business Forum and a participant at the September 2017 meeting of \\nthe former Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies \\n(``ACSEC'').\\\\661\\\\ The $100 million threshold is also aligned with the \\nSRC revenue test. Empirically, we find no obvious break in the \\ndistribution of revenue or in the results of our analysis. In general, \\nlowering the revenue threshold would reduce the expected benefits of \\nthe amendments by reducing the number of issuers that would experience \\ncost savings, while also reducing the expected costs of the amendments \\nby reducing the potential adverse impact on the reliability of \\nfinancial statements. Increasing the threshold would increase the \\nexpected benefits while also increasing the expected costs. We did not \\nreceive comments on the costs or benefits of alternative levels of a \\nrevenue threshold or of alternative metrics that should be used instead \\nof revenue (except in the case of BDCs, as discussed above).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\661\\\\ See Final Report of the 2017 SEC Government Business Forum \\non Small Business Capital Formation (Mar. 2018), available at \\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/gbfor36.pdf\\n; and William J.

Paperwork Reduction Act\\n\\nA. Summary of the Collections of Information\\n\\n    Certain provisions of our rules and forms that would be affected by \\nthe amendments contain ``collection of information'' requirements \\nwithin the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act (``PRA''). The \\nCommission published a notice requesting comment on the collection of \\ninformation requirements in the Proposing Release, and submitted the \\nproposed amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') \\nfor review in accordance with the PRA.\\\\662\\\\ While several commenters \\nprovided comments on the possible costs of the proposed \\namendments,\\\\663\\\\ no commenters specifically addressed our PRA analysis. \\nWhere appropriate, we have revised our burden estimates after \\nconsidering these comments as well as differences between the proposed \\nand final rules.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\662\\\\ 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.\\n    \\\\663\\\\ See, e.g., letters from Ardelyx Presentation, Cerecor, \\nCFA, CFA Inst., CII, Concert, Corvus, Guaranty, ICBA, Nasdaq, \\nPieris, Prof. Barth et al., Prof. Ge et al., Summit, Syros, and \\nTerra Tech.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The hours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms \\nand reports constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by each \\ncollection of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a \\nperson is not required to respond to, a collection of information \\nrequirement unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. \\nCompliance with the information collections is mandatory. Responses to \\nthe information collections are not kept confidential and there is no \\nmandatory retention period for the information disclosed. The titles \\nfor the affected collections of information are:\\n    \\n ``Form 10-K'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0063); \\\\664\\\\ and\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\664\\\\ The paperwork burden from 17 CFR 240.12b-1 through \\n240.12b-37 (``Regulation 12B'') is imposed through the forms that \\nare subject to the requirements in that regulation and is reflected \\nin the analyses of those forms. Our estimate for Forms 10-K takes \\ninto account the burden that will be incurred by including the \\ndisclosure in the applicable annual report. After the Proposing \\nRelease, note 4 above, was issued, the Office of Management and \\nBudget (``OMB'') discontinued the OMB control number for Regulation \\n12B, so that the PRA inventory would not reflect duplicative \\nburdens.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\n ``Form 10-Q'' \\\\665\\\\ (OMB Control No. 3235-0070).\\\\666\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\665\\\\ 17 CFR 249.308a.\\n    \\\\666\\\\ The only revision to this form will be changing filing \\ndeadlines, which will neither increase nor decrease the burden hours \\nnecessary to prepare the filing because there will be no change to \\nthe amount of information required in the filing.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    The regulation and forms listed above were adopted under the \\nExchange Act. The regulation and forms set forth the disclosure \\nrequirements for periodic reports filed by registrants to help \\ninvestors make informed investment decisions. A description of the \\nfinal amendments, including the need for the information and its use, \\nas well as a description of the likely respondents, can be found in \\nSection II above, and a discussion of the economic effects of the final \\namendments can be found in Section IV above.\\n\\nB. Burden and Cost Estimates Related to the Final Amendments\\n\\n    We estimate that the final amendments will result in approximately \\n527 additional issuers being classified as non-accelerated filers.\\\\667\\\\ \\nAccelerated filers are subject to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement and shorter deadlines for filing their Exchange Act \\nperiodic reports.\\\\668\\\\ Additionally, accelerated filers must provide \\ndisclosure regarding the availability of their filings and the \\ndisclosure required by Item 1B of Form 10-K and Item 4A of Form 20-F \\nabout unresolved staff comments on their periodic and/or current \\nreports.\\\\669\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\667\\\\ See Section IV.C.1. above. We estimate that there are no \\nFPIs that file on domestic forms and present their financial \\nstatements pursuant to U.S. GAAP that would meet the required \\nthresholds and other qualifications of the amendments. However, \\nthere are an estimated 31 FPIs that file on forms only available to \\nFPIs, but otherwise meet the required thresholds and other \\nqualifications. In the Proposing Release, note 4 above, we included \\nFPIs that file the forms available only to FPIs, but otherwise meet \\nthe required thresholds and other qualifications, in the number of \\naffected issuers. While these issuers could become subject to the \\namendments by changing their reporting regime, it is difficult to \\npredict how many would do so, as a result, we do not include them in \\nthe number of affected issuers in this release. Accordingly, we do \\nnot estimate any effect on the collections of information \\ncorresponding to Forms 20-F or 40-F.\\n    \\\\668\\\\ See Section II.A. above.\\n    \\\\669\\\\ See note 25 above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. ICFR Auditor Attestation Requirement\\n    We believe that expanding the exemption from the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement would reduce the PRA burden for 373 of the 527 \\naffected issuers.\\\\670\\\\ An ICFR auditor attestation is required only in \\nannual reports. Table 17, below, shows the estimated number of affected \\nissuers that are subject to the ICFR auditor attestation requirement \\nthat file on each of these forms and the average estimated audit-fee \\nand non-audit costs, as described above,\\\\671\\\\ to comply with the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\670\\\\ We estimate that the remaining 154 of the 527 affected \\nissuers are EGCs, which are not required to comply with the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement under SOX Section 404(b). See \\nSection IV.C.1. above. In addition to the 154 EGCs, we estimate that \\na further 78 of the 527 affected issuers are currently also subject \\nto the FDIC's auditor attestation requirement. See Section 18A of \\nAppendix A to FDIC Rule 363. These issuers would continue to incur \\nburden hours and costs associated with an auditor attestation \\nrequirement even under the final amendments. However, the FDIC's \\nauditor attestation requirement is not part of our rules. For \\npurposes of considering the PRA effects of the final amendments, \\ntherefore, we have reduced the burden hours and costs for these 78 \\nissuers as we would for the other affected issuers that are not \\nEGCs.\\n    \\\\671\\\\ See Sections IV.C.3. and IV.C.5. above.\\n\\n[[Page 17238]]\\n\\n\\n\\n     Table 17--Estimated Annual Costs Per Issuer of ICFR Auditor Attestation Requirement for Specified Forms\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                  Number of\\n                          Form type                                affected     Audit-fee costs  Non-audit costs\\n                                                                   issuers         per issuer       per issuer\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nForm 10-K....................................................             373         $110,000         $100,000\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Because these issuers would no longer be subject to the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement under the final amendments, they would \\nno longer incur these costs. For purposes of the PRA, this reduction in \\ntotal burden is to be allocated between a reduction in internal burden \\nhours and a reduction in outside professional costs. Table 18, below, \\nsets forth the percentage estimates we typically use for the burden \\nallocation for each form.\\n\\n   Table 18--Standard Estimated Burden Allocation for Specified Forms\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                             Outside\\n                Form type                    Internal     professionals\\n                                               (%)             (%)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nForm 10-K................................          75                25\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For the $100,000 reduction in annual non-audit costs,\\\\672\\\\ we \\nallocate the burden based on the percentages in Table 18 above. \\nHowever, we believe that 100 percent of the $110,000 annual burden \\nreduction for audit-fee costs related to the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirement should be ascribed to outside professional costs because \\nthat amount is an estimate of fees paid to the independent auditor \\nconducting the ICFR attestation audit. Table 19, below, shows the \\nresulting estimated reduction in cost per issuer associated with \\noutside professionals.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\672\\\\ As discussed in Section IV.C.3, above, in deriving this \\nestimate of the reduction in non-audit costs, we have looked to \\noutside vendor and internal labor costs, and not to non-labor costs, \\nbecause we believe that those non-labor costs (such as software, \\nhardware, and travel costs) are primarily attributable to \\nmanagement's ICFR responsibilities under SOX Section 404(a) and thus \\nwould continue to be incurred. To the extent elimination of the \\nauditor attestation requirement also results in a reduction in \\nmanagement's time burden, we believe this reduction generally would \\nbe captured by the estimated $100,000 reduction, as this amount \\nreflects an overall reduction in non-audit costs.\\n\\n                  Table 19--Estimated Reduction in Outside Professional Costs From Elimination of ICFR Auditor Attestation Requirement\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                                                        Total outside\\n                                                                         Outside          Outside        professional                    Total reduction\\n                                                                       professional     professional      costs per        Number of        in outside\\n                      Issuer type (form used)                           costs per        costs per       issuer (non-       affected       professional\\n                                                                       issuer (non-    issuer (audit    audit + audit       issuers           costs\\n                                                                          audit)           fees)            fees)\\n[A]                                                                             [B]                [C]            [D]              [E]          (D x E)\\n                                                                                                                                                    [F]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nForm 10-K..........................................................         $25,000         $110,000         $135,000              373      $50,355,000\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For PRA purposes, an issuer's internal burden is estimated in \\ninternal burden hours. We are, therefore, converting the internal \\nportions of the non-audit costs to burden hours. These activities would \\nmostly be performed by a number of different employees with different \\nlevels of knowledge, expertise, and responsibility. We believe these \\ninternal labor costs will be less than the $400 per hour figure we \\ntypically use for outside professionals retained by the issuer. \\nTherefore, we use an average rate of $200 per hour to estimate an \\nissuer's internal non-audit labor costs.

Filing Deadlines, Disclosure Regarding Filing Availability, and \\nUnresolved Staff Comments\\n    As the Commission has recognized previously, changing filing \\ndeadlines neither increases nor decreases the burden hours necessary to \\nprepare the filing because there is no change to the amount of \\ninformation required in the\\n\\n[[Page 17239]]\\n\\nfiling.\\\\673\\\\ Therefore, we do not believe that the change to the filing \\ndeadlines will affect an issuer's burden hours or costs for PRA \\npurposes.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\673\\\\ Revisions to Accelerated Filer Definition and Accelerated \\nDeadlines for Filing Periodic Reports, Release No. 33-8644 (Dec. 21, \\n2005) [70 FR 76634 (Dec. 27, 2005)].\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We believe that eliminating the requirements to provide disclosure \\nregarding the availability of their filings and the disclosure required \\nby Item 1B of Form 10-K and Item 4A of Form 20-F about unresolved staff \\ncomments on their periodic and/or current reports will reduce their \\nburden hours and costs, but we do not expect that reduction to be \\nsignificant.

Check Box Disclosure\\n    In a change from the proposed amendments, the final amendments add \\na check box to the cover pages of their annual reports on Forms 10-K, \\n20-F, and 40-F for issuers to indicate that they included an ICFR \\nauditor attestation in the filing. In addition, if the issuer is \\notherwise required to tag cover page disclosure data using Inline XBRL, \\nit must also to tag the cover page check box disclosure using Inline \\nXBRL. Issuers must already determine whether they are subject to the \\nICFR auditor attestation requirement, so requiring issuers to add a \\ncheck box to the cover pages of their annual reports on Forms 10-K, 20-\\nF, and 40-F, and check that box if they provide the ICFR auditor \\nattestation, will not substantively modify existing collection of \\ninformation requirements or otherwise affect the overall burden \\nestimates associated with these forms. Therefore, we are not adjusting \\nany burden or cost estimates in connection with the check box \\nrequirement in the final amendments\\n4.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis\\n\\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') \\\\675\\\\ requires the \\nCommission, in promulgating rules under Section 553 of the \\nAdministrative Procedure Act,\\\\676\\\\ to consider the impact of those \\nrules on small entities. We have prepared this Final Regulatory \\nFlexibility Analysis (``FRFA'') in accordance with Section 604 of the \\nRFA.\\\\677\\\\ This FRFA relates to the amendments to the accelerated filer \\nand large accelerated filer definitions in Rule 12b-2 under the \\nExchange Act and the addition of a check box to the cover pages of \\nForms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F to indicate whether an ICFR auditor \\nattestation is included in the filing. An Initial Regulatory \\nFlexibility Analysis (``IRFA'') was prepared in accordance with the RFA \\nand was included in the Proposing Release.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\675\\\\ 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\\n    \\\\676\\\\ 5 U.S.C. 553.\\n    \\\\677\\\\ 5 U.S.C. 604.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA. Need for, and Objectives of, the Final Amendments\\n\\n    The purpose of the amendments to the accelerated filer and large \\naccelerated filer definitions in Rule 12b-2 is to promote capital \\nformation by more appropriately tailoring the types of issuers that are \\nincluded in the category of accelerated filers and revising the \\ntransition thresholds for accelerated and large accelerated filers. The \\naddition of the check box to the cover pages of Forms 10-K, 20-F, and \\n40-F is intended to provide more prominent and easily accessible \\ndisclosure of this information for investors and market participants \\nwhile imposing only minimal burdens on issuers. The need for, and \\nobjectives of, the amendments are discussed in more detail in Sections \\nI and II above.\\n\\nB. Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments\\n\\n    In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on all aspects of \\nthe\\n\\n[[Page 17240]]\\n\\nIRFA, including the number of small entities that would be affected by \\nthe proposed amendments, the existence or nature of the potential \\nimpact of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis, \\nand how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments. We did not \\nreceive any comments specifically addressing the IRFA. However, we \\nreceived a number of comments on the proposed amendments, \\ngenerally,\\\\678\\\\ and have considered all of these comments in developing \\nthe FRFA because the final amendments are focused on smaller issuers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\678\\\\ See Section II.B.2. above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We believe that the final amendments will reduce disclosure burdens \\nby expanding the number of registrants that will no longer qualify as \\naccelerated or large accelerated filers, which will eliminate the ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement for those issuers, while maintaining \\ninvestor protections.\\n\\nC. Small Entities Subject to the Amendments\\n\\n    The final amendments will affect some registrants that are small \\nentities. The RFA defines ``small entity'' to mean ``small business,'' \\n``small organization,'' or ``small governmental jurisdiction.'' \\\\679\\\\ \\nFor purposes of the RFA, under our rules, an issuer, other than an \\ninvestment company, is a ``small business'' or ``small organization'' \\nif it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its \\nmost recent fiscal year.\\\\680\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\679\\\\ 5 U.S.C. 601(6).\\n    \\\\680\\\\ See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a) under the Exchange Act.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    We estimate that there are 1,171 issuers that file with the \\nCommission, other than investment companies, which may be considered \\nsmall entities and are potentially subject to the final \\namendments.\\\\681\\\\ Investment companies, which include BDCs, qualify as \\nsmall entities if, together with other investment companies in the same \\ngroup of related investment companies, they have net assets of $50 \\nmillion or less as of the end of their most recent fiscal year.\\\\682\\\\ \\nCommission staff estimates that, as of June 2019, approximately 16 BDCs \\nare small entities.\\\\683\\\\ We believe it is likely that virtually all \\nissuers that would be considered small businesses or small \\norganizations, as defined in our rules, are already non-accelerated \\nfilers and would continue to be encompassed within that category. To \\nthe extent any such issuers are not already non-accelerated filers, we \\nbelieve it is likely that the final amendments will capture those \\nentities.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\681\\\\ This estimate is based on staff analysis of issuers, \\nexcluding co-registrants, with EDGAR filings of Form 10-K, 20-F and \\n40-F, or amendments, filed during the calendar year of January 1, \\n2018 to December 31, 2018. This analysis is based on data from XBRL \\nfilings, Compustat, and Ives Group Audit Analytics.\\n    \\\\682\\\\ 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).\\n    \\\\683\\\\ These estimates are based on staff analysis of Morningstar \\ndata and data submitted by investment company registrants in forms \\nfiled on EDGAR as of June 2019.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nD. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance \\nRequirements\\n\\n    As noted above, the final amendments will reduce the number of \\naccelerated and large accelerated filers, which will reduce the \\ncompliance burden for those issuers, some of which may be small \\nentities, because they would no longer have to satisfy the ICFR auditor \\nattestation requirement, comply with accelerated deadlines for filing \\ntheir Exchange Act periodic reports, provide disclosure regarding the \\navailability of their filings, or provide disclosure required by Item \\n1B of Form 10-K and Item 4A of Form 20-F about unresolved staff \\ncomments on their periodic and/or current reports.\\\\684\\\\ The ICFR \\nauditor attestation requirement applies only to accelerated and large \\naccelerated filers, and most small entities would not qualify for \\neither filer status. Compliance with certain rules affected by the \\namendments require the use of professional skills, including accounting \\nand legal skills. The final amendments are discussed in detail in \\nSections I and II above. We discuss the economic effect including the \\nestimated costs and burdens, of the final amendments on all \\nregistrants, including small entities, in Section IV above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\684\\\\ The amendments to include a check box on Forms 10-K, 20-F, \\nand 40-F are not expected to affect the overall burden estimates \\nassociated with these forms. See Section V.C.3. above.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nE. Agency Action To Minimize Effect on Small Entities\\n\\n    The RFA directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish \\nour stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse effect \\non small entities. Accordingly, we considered the following \\nalternatives:\\n    \\n Establishing different compliance or reporting \\nrequirements or timetables that take into account the resources \\navailable to small entities;\\n    \\n Clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and \\nreporting requirements for small entities under our rules as revised by \\nthe amendments;\\n    \\n Using performance rather than design standards; and\\n    \\n Exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of \\nthe amendments.\\n    We do not believe that establishing different compliance or \\nreporting obligations in conjunction with the final amendments is \\nnecessary. The final amendments would not impose any significant new \\ncompliance obligations. In fact, the final amendments would reduce the \\ncompliance obligations of affected issuers by increasing the number of \\nissuers, including small entities, that are subject to the different, \\nless burdensome, compliance and reporting obligations for non-\\naccelerated filers. Similarly, because the final amendments would \\nreduce the burdens for these issuers, we do not believe it is \\nappropriate to exempt small entities from all or part of the proposed \\namendments.\\n    We believe that some of the issuers that would become eligible to \\nbe non-accelerated filers under the final amendments may be smaller \\nentities. Therefore, to the extent that any small entities would become \\nnewly eligible for non-accelerated filer status under the final \\namendments, their compliance and reporting requirements would be \\nfurther simplified. We note in this regard that the Commission's \\nexisting disclosure requirements provide for scaled disclosure \\nrequirements and other accommodations for small entities, and the final \\namendments would not alter these existing accommodations.\\n    The check box requirement should not affect small entities unless \\nthey voluntarily choose to comply with the ICFR auditor attestation \\nrequirements. Further, we note that the compliance burden associated \\nwith the check box is expected to be minimal, and establishing a \\ndifferent compliance requirement, providing additional clarification of \\nthe requirement, or exempting a small entity would not, therefore, have \\na meaningful impact on the small entity.\\n    Finally, with respect to the use of performance rather than design \\nstandards, because the final amendments are not expected to have any \\nsignificant adverse effect on small entities (and may, in fact, relieve \\nburdens for some such entities), we do not believe it is necessary to \\nuse performance standards in connection with this rulemaking.\\n\\nStatutory Authority and Text of Rule Amendments\\n\\n    The rule amendments described in this release are being adopted \\npursuant to Sections 7, 10, 19(a), and 28 of the Securities Act, as \\namended, and Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 15(d), and 23(a) of the Exchange \\nAct, as amended.\\n\\n[[Page 17241]]\\n\\nList of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 229, 230, 240, and 249\\n\\n    Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.\\n\\n    For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Commission amends \\ntitle 17, chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:\\n\\nPART 229--STANDARD INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING FORMS UNDER SECURITIES \\nACT OF 1933, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND ENERGY POLICY AND \\nCONSERVATION ACT OF 1975--REGULATION S-K\\n\\n0\\n1.

This staff accounting bulletin (``SAB'') adds \\ninterpretive guidance for entities to consider when they have \\nobligations to safeguard crypto-assets held for their platform users. \\nThis SAB is applicable to entities that file reports pursuant to \\nSections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \\n(``Exchange Act'') and entities that have submitted or filed a \\nregistration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities \\nAct'') or the Exchange Act that is not yet effective. The SAB is also \\napplicable to entities submitting or filing an offering statement or \\npost-qualification amendment thereto under Regulation A, entities \\nsubject to the periodic and the current reporting requirements of \\nRegulation A, and private operating companies whose financial \\nstatements are included in filings with the SEC in connection with a \\nbusiness combination involving a shell company, including a special \\npurpose acquisition company. Accordingly, the staff hereby amends the \\nStaff Accounting Bulletin Series as follows:\\n* * * * *\\n\\nTopic 5: Miscellaneous Accounting\\n\\n* * * * *\\n    The interpretations in this SAB express views of the staff \\nregarding the accounting for entities that have obligations to \\nsafeguard crypto-assets held for their platform users.\\\\1\\\\ In recent \\nyears, the staff has observed an increase in the number of entities \\nthat provide platform users with the ability to transact in crypto-\\nassets. In connection with these services, these entities and/or their \\nagents may safeguard the platform user's crypto-asset(s) and also \\nmaintain the cryptographic key information necessary to access the \\ncrypto-asset. The obligations associated with these arrangements \\ninvolve unique risks and uncertainties not present in arrangements to \\nsafeguard assets that are not crypto-assets, including technological, \\nlegal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties. Specifically:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\1\\\\ This SAB expresses no view with respect to any other \\nquestions that these activities may raise for any of the entities \\ninvolved, including the applicability of the registration or other \\nprovisions of the federal securities laws or any other federal, \\nstate, or foreign laws.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\n Technological risks--there are risks with respect to both \\nsafeguarding of assets and rapidly-changing crypto-assets in the market \\nthat are not present with other arrangements to safeguard assets for \\nthird parties;\\n    \\n Legal risks--due to the unique characteristics of the \\nassets and the lack of legal precedent, there are significant legal \\nquestions surrounding how such arrangements would be treated in a court \\nproceeding arising from an adverse event (e.g., fraud, loss, theft, or \\nbankruptcy); and\\n    \\n Regulatory risks--as compared to many common arrangements \\nto safeguard assets for third parties, there are significantly fewer \\nregulatory requirements for holding crypto-assets for platform users or \\nentities may not be complying with regulatory requirements that do \\napply, which results in increased risks to investors in these entities.\\n    These risks can have a significant impact on the entity's \\noperations and financial condition. The staff believes that the \\nrecognition, measurement, and disclosure guidance in this SAB will \\nenhance the information received by investors and other users of \\nfinancial statements about these risks, thereby assisting them in \\nmaking investment and other capital allocation decisions.\\n\\nFF. Accounting for Obligations To Safeguard Crypto-Assets an Entity \\nHolds for Its Platform Users\\n\\n    Facts: Entity A's \\\\2\\\\ business includes operating a platform that \\nallows its users to transact in crypto-assets.\\\\3\\\\ Entity A also \\nprovides a service where it will safeguard the platform users' crypto-\\nassets,\\\\4\\\\ including maintaining the cryptographic key information \\\\5\\\\ \\nnecessary to access the crypto-assets. Entity A also maintains internal \\nrecordkeeping of the amount of crypto-assets held for the benefit of \\neach platform user. Entity A secures these crypto-assets and protects \\nthem from loss or theft, and any failure to do so exposes Entity A to \\nsignificant risks, including a risk of financial loss. The platform \\nusers have the right to request that Entity A transact in the crypto-\\nasset on the user's behalf (e.g., to sell the crypto-asset and provide \\nthe user with the fiat currency (cash) proceeds associated with the \\nsale) or to transfer the crypto-asset to a digital wallet for which \\nEntity A does not maintain the cryptographic key information.\\n\\n[[Page 21017]]\\n\\nHowever, execution and settlement of transactions involving the \\nplatform users' crypto-assets may depend on actions taken by Entity A.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\2\\\\ References throughout this SAB to ``Entity A'' are inclusive \\nof the entity as well as any agent acting on its behalf in \\nsafeguarding the platform users' crypto-assets.\\n    \\\\3\\\\ For purposes of this SAB, the term ``crypto-asset'' refers \\nto a digital asset that is issued and/or transferred using \\ndistributed ledger or blockchain technology using cryptographic \\ntechniques.\\n    \\\\4\\\\ The service may be provided by Entity A or by an agent \\nacting on Entity A's behalf.\\n    \\\\5\\\\ The guidance in this SAB is applicable regardless of whether \\nthe cryptographic key remains in the name of the platform user or is \\nin the name of the Entity.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Question 1: How should Entity A account for its obligations to \\nsafeguard crypto-assets held for platform users?\\n    Interpretive Response: The ability of Entity A's platform users to \\nobtain future benefits from crypto-assets in digital wallets where \\nEntity A holds the cryptographic key information is dependent on the \\nactions of Entity A to safeguard the assets. Those actions include \\nsecuring the crypto-assets and the associated cryptographic key \\ninformation and protecting them from loss, theft, or other misuse. The \\ntechnological mechanisms supporting how crypto-assets are issued, held, \\nor transferred, as well as legal uncertainties regarding holding \\ncrypto-assets for others, create significant increased risks to Entity \\nA, including an increased risk of financial loss.\\\\6\\\\ Accordingly, as \\nlong as Entity A is responsible for safeguarding the crypto-assets held \\nfor its platform users, including maintaining the cryptographic key \\ninformation necessary to access the crypto-assets, the staff believes \\nthat Entity A should present a liability on its balance sheet to \\nreflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for its \\nplatform users.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\6\\\\ See generally Report of the Attorney General's Cyber Digital \\nTask Force: Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework (Oct. 2020), at 15-\\n16, available at \\nhttps://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1326061/download\\n.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    As Entity A's loss exposure is based on the significant risks \\nassociated with safeguarding the crypto-assets held for its platform \\nusers, the staff believes it would be appropriate to measure this \\nsafeguarding liability at initial recognition and each reporting date \\nat the fair value \\\\7\\\\ of the crypto-assets that Entity A is responsible \\nfor holding for its platform users. The staff also believes it would be \\nappropriate for Entity A to recognize an asset \\\\8\\\\ at the same time \\nthat it recognizes the safeguarding liability, measured at initial \\nrecognition and each reporting date at the fair value of the crypto-\\nassets held for its platform users.\\\\9\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\7\\\\ For U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``U.S. \\nGAAP''), refer to glossary definition provided in Financial \\nAccounting Standards Board (``FASB'') Accounting Standards \\nCodification (``ASC'') Topic 820. For International Financial \\nReporting Standards (``IFRS''), refer to glossary definition \\nprovided in IFRS 13.\\n    \\\\8\\\\ The asset recognized is similar in nature to an \\nindemnification asset as described in FASB ASC 805 and IFRS 3. The \\nmeasurement of the asset is on the same basis as the crypto-asset \\nsafeguarding liability assumed by the entity. The asset recognized \\nby the entity is separate and distinct from the crypto-asset itself \\nthat has been transferred to and then held for the platform user.\\n    \\\\9\\\\ Similar to the guidance in FASB ASC 805 and IFRS 3, Entity A \\nwould need to evaluate whether any potential loss events, such as \\ntheft, impact the measurement of the asset.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Question 2: Assume the same facts as Question 1. What disclosures \\nwould the staff expect Entity A to provide regarding its safeguarding \\nobligations for crypto-assets held for its platform users?\\n    Interpretive Response: In light of the significant risks and \\nuncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto-assets, including the \\nrisks of loss associated with holding the cryptographic key information \\nnecessary to secure and transact in the crypto-asset, the staff \\nbelieves the notes to the financial statements should include clear \\ndisclosure of the nature and amount of crypto-assets that Entity A is \\nresponsible for holding for its platform users, with separate \\ndisclosure for each significant crypto-asset, and the vulnerabilities \\nEntity A has due to any concentration in such activities.\\\\10\\\\ In \\naddition, because the crypto-asset safeguarding liabilities and the \\ncorresponding assets are measured at the fair value of the crypto-\\nassets held for its platform users, the entity would be required to \\ninclude disclosures regarding fair value measurements.\\\\11\\\\ The \\naccounting for the liabilities and corresponding assets should be \\ndescribed in the footnotes to the financial statements.\\\\12\\\\ In \\nproviding these disclosures, Entity A should consider disclosure about \\nwho (e.g., the company, its agent, or another third party) holds the \\ncryptographic key information, maintains the internal recordkeeping of \\nthose assets, and is obligated to secure the assets and protect them \\nfrom loss or theft.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\10\\\\ For U.S. GAAP, see FASB ASC 275-10-50. For IFRS, see IAS 1.\\n    \\\\11\\\\ For U.S. GAAP, see FASB ASC 820. For IFRS, see IFRS 13.\\n    \\\\12\\\\ For U.S. GAAP, see FASB ASC 235-10-50. For IFRS, see IAS 1.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Disclosures regarding the significant risks and uncertainties \\nassociated with the entity holding crypto-assets for its platform users \\nmay also be required outside the financial statements under existing \\nCommission rules, such as in the description of business, risk factors, \\nor management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and \\nresults of operation.\\\\13\\\\ For example, to the extent it is material, \\nEntity A may need to provide disclosure describing the types of loss or \\nadditional obligations that could occur, including customer or user \\ndiscontinuation or reduction of use of services, litigation, \\nreputational harm, and regulatory enforcement actions and additional \\nrestrictions. A discussion of the analysis of the legal ownership of \\nthe crypto-assets held for platform users, including whether they would \\nbe available to satisfy general creditor claims in the event of a \\nbankruptcy should be considered. Further, Entity A may need to provide \\ndisclosure of the potential impact that the destruction, loss, theft, \\nor compromise or unavailability of the cryptographic key information \\nwould have to the ongoing business, financial condition, operating \\nresults, and cash flows of the entity. As part of this disclosure, \\nEntity A should also consider including, to the extent material, \\ninformation about risk-mitigation steps the entity has put in place \\n(e.g., insurance coverage directly related to the crypto-assets held \\nfor platform users).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\13\\\\ See, e.g., Item 101 of Regulation S-K; Item 105 of \\nRegulation S-K; Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Question 3: How and when should Company A initially apply the \\nguidance in this Topic in its financial statements?\\n    Interpretive Response: The staff would expect an entity that files \\nreports pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, \\nor an entity required to file periodic and current reports pursuant to \\nRule 257(b) of Regulation A, to apply the guidance in Topic 5.FF no \\nlater than its financial statements covering the first interim or \\nannual period ending after June 15, 2022, with retrospective \\napplication as of the beginning of the fiscal year to which the interim \\nor annual period relates.\\n    The staff expects all other entities, including but not limited to \\nentities conducting an initial registration of securities under the \\nSecurities Act or Exchange Act, entities conducting an offering of \\nsecurities under Regulation A, and private operating companies entering \\ninto a business combination transaction with a shell company, including \\na special purpose acquisition company, to apply the guidance in Topic \\n5.FF beginning with their next submission or filing with the SEC (e.g., \\nthe initial or next amendment of the registration statement, proxy \\nstatement, or Form 1-A), with retrospective application, at a minimum, \\nas of the beginning of the most recent annual period ending before June \\n15, 2022, provided the filing also includes a subsequent interim period \\nthat also reflects application of this guidance.\\\\14\\\\ If\\n\\n[[Page 21018]]\\n\\nthe filing does not include a subsequent interim period that also \\nreflects application of this guidance, then the staff expects it to be \\napplied retrospectively to the beginning of the two most recent annual \\nperiods ending before June 15, 2022.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\14\\\\ For example, a calendar year-end company that submits a \\nregistration statement in January 2023 including financial \\nstatements as of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 \\nand as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 would \\napply the SAB to those periods.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    For all entities, in the financial statements that reflect the \\ninitial application of this guidance, the effect of the initial \\napplication should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and \\nliabilities as of the beginning of the annual period specified above. \\nEntities should include clear disclosure of the effects of the initial \\napplication of this guidance.\\\\15\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\15\\\\ For U.S. GAAP, see FASB ASC 250-10-50-1 through 50-3; for \\nIFRS, see IAS 8.

amendments \\\\4\\\\ to the ``accelerated filer'' and ``large accelerated filer'' definitions in rule 12b-2.\\\\5\\\\ we proposed these amendments to promote capital formation for certain smaller issuers while maintaining investor protections by more appropriately tailoring the types of issuers that are included in the categories of accelerated and large accelerated filers and revising the transition thresholds for accelerated and large accelerated filers. specifically, we proposed to exclude from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions an issuer that is eligible to be a smaller reporting company (``src'') \\\\6\\\\ and that has annual revenue of less than $100 million in the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available (``src revenue test''), with the effect that such an issuer would not need to satisfy the requirements applicable to an accelerated or large accelerated filer. we also proposed to increase the public float transition threshold for accelerated and large accelerated filers to become a non-accelerated filer from $50 million to $60 million, and to increase the exit threshold in the large accelerated filer transition provision from $500 million to $560 million in public float. finally, we proposed to add a revenue test to the transition thresholds for exiting both accelerated and large accelerated filer status. \\\\4\\\\ amendments to the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions, release no. 34-85814 (may 9, 2019) [84 fr 24876 (may 29, 2019)] (``proposing release''). \\\\5\\\\ although rule 12b-2 defines the terms ``accelerated filer'' and ``large accelerated filer,'' it does not define the term ``non- accelerated filer.'' if an issuer does not meet the definition of accelerated filer or large accelerated filer, it is considered a non-accelerated filer. \\\\6\\\\ see item 10(f), rule 405, and rule 12b-2 (defining src). we received over 60 comment letters on the proposal, including over 40 unique letters and approximately 20 letters that were substantially similar. many of the commenters generally supported the proposed amendments \\\\7\\\\ while other commenters generally opposed them or suggested the need for further empirical study.\\\\8\\\\ in addition, the sec's small business capital formation advisory committee (``sbcfac'') adopted a recommendation supporting the proposed amendments,\\\\9\\\\ and the 2019 sec government-business forum on small business capital formation (``sec small business forum'') provided a recommendation on the accelerated filer definition.\\\\10\\\\ after taking into consideration these recommendations and the public comments, we are adopting the amendments substantially as proposed. the final amendments are consistent with our historical practice of providing scaled disclosure and other accommodations for smaller issuers and with recent actions by congress to reduce unnecessary burdens on new and smaller issuers.\\\\11\\\\ \\\\7\\\\ see, e.g., letters from adamas pharmaceuticals, inc.

(august 23, 2019) (``sbcfac recommendations''), available at . although it supported the proposed amendments, the sbcfac stated that it ``would welcome the commission to explore additional further amendments'' to the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions and recommended exploring raising the revenue threshold to be a non-accelerated filer to one higher than $100 million, basing the revenue test for an issuer to qualify as a non-accelerated filer on a three-year rolling average instead of basing it on the revenue in the most recent fiscal year, and looking at whether all srcs should be non-accelerated filers. \\\\10\\\\ see you.s. sec. and exch. comm'n gov't-bus. forum on small bus. capital formation, report on the 38th annual government- business forum on small business capital formation (august 14, 2019) (``sec small business forum''), available at . the sec small business forum recommended aligning the definition of non-accelerated filer with the definition of src to include issuers with a public float less than $250 million or with annual revenues less than $100 million (and either no public float or a public float less than $700 million). \\\\11\\\\ for example, title i of the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 (``jobs act'') amended section 404(b) of the sarbanes- oxley act (``sox''), 15 you.s.c. 7262(b), which relates to an issuer's icfr to exempt emerging growth companies (``egcs'') from the requirement of sox section 404(b). in particular, sox section 404(b) requires that an issuer's independent auditor attest to, and report on, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the issuer's icfr (``icfr auditor attestation''). see public law 112-106, sec. 103, 126 stat. 306 (2012). in addition, section 72002 of the fixing america's surface transportation act of 2015 requires the commission to revise regulation s-k to further scale or eliminate requirements to reduce the burden on egcs, accelerated filers, srcs, and other smaller issuers, while still providing all material information to investors. see public law 114-94, 129 stat. 1312 (2015). ii. discussion of the final amendments a. background in june 2018, the commission adopted amendments \\\\12\\\\ to the src definition \\\\13\\\\ to expand the number of issuers that qualify for scaled disclosure accommodations. the amended src definition allows an issuer to use either a public float \\\\14\\\\ test or the src revenue test to determine whether it is an src. the amendments increased the threshold in the public float test for an issuer to initially qualify as an src from less than $75 million to less than $250 million.\\\\15\\\\ the commission also expanded the revenue test to include issuers with annual revenues \\\\16\\\\ of less than $100 million if they have no public float or a public float of less than $700 million.\\\\17\\\\ the commission intended the amendments to promote capital formation for smaller issuers by reducing compliance costs for the newly eligible srcs while maintaining appropriate investor protections.\\\\18\\\\ \\\\12\\\\ see smaller reporting company definition, release no. 33- 10513 (june 28, 2018) [83 fr 31992 (july 10, 2018)] (``src adopting release''). \\\\13\\\\ see note 6 above. \\\\14\\\\ public float is defined in paragraph (3)(i)(a) of the src definition in rule 12b-2, which states that public float is measured as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter and computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity. see also item 10(f) (2)(i)(a) and rule 405. an entity with no public float because, for example, it has equity securities outstanding but is not trading in any public trading market would not be able to qualify on the basis of a public float test alone. that entity must look to the src revenue test to determine whether it qualifies as an src. \\\\15\\\\ to avoid situations where an issuer frequently enters and exits src status, each test includes two thresholdsone for initially determining whether an issuer qualifies as an src and a subsequent transition threshold that is lower for issuers that did not initially qualify as an src, or that no longer qualify as an src because they exceeded the initial thresholds. \\\\16\\\\ annual revenues are measured as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. see item 10(f)(2)(i)(b), rule 405, and rule 12b-2. \\\\17\\\\ see item 10(f)(1), rule 405, and rule 12b-2. the prior revenue test included issuers with no public float and annual revenues of less than $50 million. see src adopting release, note 12 above, at 31995. the lower transition thresholds under the revenue test for an issuer that did not initially qualify as an src, or that no longer qualifies as an src because it exceeded the initial thresholds, were revised from less than $40 million of annual revenues and no public float to less than $80 million of annual revenues and either no public float or a public float of less than $560 million. see item 10(f)(2)(iii)(b), rule 405, and rule 12b-2. \\\\18\\\\ src adopting release, note 12 above, at 31992. in conjunction with these amendments, the commission also revised the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2 to remove the condition that, for an issuer to be an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer, it must not be eligible to use the src accommodations.\\\\19\\\\ one result of these amendments is that some issuers now are categorized as both srcs and accelerated or large accelerated filers.\\\\20\\\\ these issuers have some, but not all, of the benefits of scaled regulation. in particular, issuers that are categorized as both srcs and accelerated or large accelerated filers must comply with the earlier filing deadlines required of accelerated and large accelerated filers for annual and quarterly reports and the requirement of sox section 404(b).\\\\21\\\\ \\\\19\\\\ this amendment, among other things, preserved the existing thresholds in those definitions and did not change the number of issuers subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. \\\\20\\\\ although rare, under our existing rules, some issuers that meet the large accelerated filer definition may be eligible to be an src because of the expanded revenue test in the src definition. see proposing release, note 4 above, at 24877, n. 25. as discussed below, in section ii.b.3., we are adopting the proposed amendment to the ``large accelerated filer'' definition so that an issuer that is eligible to be an src under the src revenue test would not also qualify as a large accelerated filer. \\\\21\\\\ 15 you.s.c. 7262(b). prior to the src amendments, the src category of filers generally did not overlap with either the accelerated or large accelerated filer categories.\\\\22\\\\ now, however, as illustrated in figure 1 of this section, because the public float tests in the src and accelerated filer definitions partially overlap, and the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions no longer specifically exclude an issuer that is eligible to be an src, an issuer meeting the accelerated filer definition will be both an src and an accelerated filer \\\\23\\\\ if it has: \\\\22\\\\ see src adopting release, note 12 above, at 32001. \\\\23\\\\ the thresholds provided below are based on the initial thresholds of each definition; however, due to the transition provisions of the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions, additional issuers may also be both an src and an accelerated or large accelerated filer. a public float of $75 million or more, but less than $250 million, regardless of annual revenues; or less than $100 million in annual revenues, and a public float of $250 million or more, but less than $700 million. [graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.000 b. amendments to exclude low-revenue srcs from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions 1. proposed amendments under the existing accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2, an issuer must satisfy three conditions to be an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer.\\\\24\\\\ we proposed to add a new condition to the definitions of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer that would exclude from those definitions an issuer that is eligible to be an src and that meets the src revenue test. the most notable effect of the proposed amendments \\\\25\\\\ would be that an issuer that is eligible to be an src and that meets the src revenue test would not be subject to the requirement of sox section 404(b) that an issuer's independent auditor must attest to, and report on, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the issuer's icfr.\\\\26\\\\ the final amendments do not change an auditor's role in a financial statement audit.\\\\27\\\\ \\\\24\\\\ the three existing conditions for qualifying as an accelerated filer are that an issuer: (1) had an aggregate worldwide public float of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter; (2) has been subject to the requirements of 15 you.s.c. 78m (exchange act section 13(a)) or 15 you.s.c. 78o(d) (exchange act section 15(d)) for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and (3) has filed at least one annual report pursuant to those sections. for a large accelerated filer, conditions (2) and (3) are the same, but condition (1) is that an issuer had an aggregate worldwide public float of $700 million or more, as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter. also, as discussed in note 20 above, some issuers that meet the ``large accelerated filer'' definition may be eligible to be an src. \\\\25\\\\ the issuer also would not have to abide by the filing deadlines of an accelerated or large accelerated filer, provide the disclosure required by item 1b of form 10-k and item 4a of form 20-f about unresolved staff comments on its periodic andor current reports, or provide the disclosure required by item 101(e)(4) of regulation s-k about whether it makes filings available on or through its internet website. see 17 cfr 229.101(e)(4). \\\\26\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.13a-15(f) and 17 cfr 240.15d-15(f) (defining icfr). \\\\27\\\\ see letter from deloitte (suggesting that the commission explain how an auditor's role in a financial statement audit will change as a result of the amendments). sox section 404(a) \\\\28\\\\ requires almost all issuers, including srcs, that file reports pursuant to exchange act section 13(a) or 15(d) \\\\29\\\\ to establish and maintain icfr and have their management assess the effectiveness of their icfr.\\\\30\\\\ sox section 404(b) subjects certain issuers not otherwise exempted to the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\31\\\\ the most significant exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement is the exemption provided to egcs pursuant to title i of the jobs act (``jobs act exemption''). generally, an egc is a company that has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year end and that has not sold common equity securities under a registration statement.\\\\32\\\\ the jobs act exemption provides egcs with a five-year exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. we estimate that the jobs act exemption applies to issuers with an aggregate market capitalization of about $585 billion, compared to about $95 billion in aggregate for the issuers that are newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement under the amendments.\\\\33\\\\ \\\\28\\\\ 15 you.s.c. 7262(a). \\\\29\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.13a-15 and 17 cfr 240.15d-15. \\\\30\\\\ investment companies registered under section 8 of the investment company act of 1940, 15 you.s.c 80a-8, are specifically exempted from sox section 404 by sox section 405, 15 you.s.c. 7263. notwithstanding the exemption pursuant to sox section 405, these registered investment companies are subject to other requirements regarding internal controls. see proposing release, note 4 above, at 24879, n. 44. \\\\31\\\\ for example, sox section 404(c) exempts from section 404(b) any issuer that is neither a large accelerated filer nor an accelerated filer. see 15 you.s.c. 7262(c). \\\\32\\\\ see 15 you.s.c. 77(b)(a)(19). \\\\33\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of data on market values from compustat for annual reports in calendar year 2018. see note 298 below for details on the identification of the population of different filer types. see note 336 below for details on the identification of the population of affected issuers. out of the 1,430 issuers who qualified as egcs in 2018, 1,097 are also non- accelerated filers. the remaining egcs are still exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement solely due to the jobs act exemption, and those issuers are significantly larger in terms of aggregate market capitalization (approximately $145 billion) than the issuers newly exempted under the amendments (approximately $95 billion). this estimate excludes 41 egcs with an aggregate of approximately $20 billion in market capitalization for which we are unable to determine non-accelerated filer status, the majority of which are canadian issuers filing on form 40-f. 2. comments on the proposed amendments many commenters supported the portion of the proposed amendments that would exclude an issuer that is eligible to be an src and that meets the src revenue test from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions.\\\\34\\\\ other commenters opposed the proposed amendments or suggested the need for further analysis.\\\\35\\\\ commenters' views on different aspects of the proposal, as well as its effects, are discussed topically, below. \\\\34\\\\ see, e.g., letters from adamas, advamed, advamed et al., aequor, andersen, ardelyx, ardelyx's slides from its presentation

revenue for determining accelerated and large accelerated filer status a number of commenters stated explicitly that they supported using revenue as a measure to determine whether an issuer should be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\36\\\\ these commenters suggested that using a revenue measurement is preferable to using a public float measurement \\\\37\\\\ because public float is often affected by industry or economic trends not specific to any particular issuer,\\\\38\\\\ and that revenue is more predictable,\\\\39\\\\ a better indicator of an issuer's complexity,\\\\40\\\\ and a better indicator of an issuer's ability to absorb the burdens of the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\41\\\\ other commenters questioned whether revenue is an appropriate measure for determining whether an issuer should be a non-accelerated filer in all cases.\\\\42\\\\ one commenter asserted that low-revenue companies may have less sophisticated or experienced accounting functions and some aspects of their business may be associated with accounting complexities.\\\\43\\\\ this commenter also suggested that issuers may recognize revenue in ways that could result in them frequently transitioning in and out of non-accelerated filer status.\\\\44\\\\ another commenter indicated that an issuer could have a relatively low amount of revenue but still have a large market capitalization and thus ``greater investor exposure.'' \\\\45\\\\ \\\\36\\\\ see, e.g., letters from bio, broadmark, chamber, concert, corvus, and msb. \\\\37\\\\ see, e.g.,

\\\\43\\\\ see letter from ey. \\\\44\\\\ id. \\\\45\\\\ see letter from grant thornton. b. comments on the proposed amendments' effect on capital formation and the number of public issuers commenters expressed mixed views on the effect that the proposed amendments would have on capital formation, the cost of capital, and the decisions of companies as to whether to enter the public capital markets. some commenters agreed with the view expressed in the proposing release that, by expanding the jobs act exemption, the proposed amendments would enhance capital formation or allow affected issuers to preserve capital \\\\46\\\\ while also maintaining investor protection.\\\\47\\\\ one commenter, questioning the benefits, if any, of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, asserted that there is no correlation between a smaller issuer's compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement and stronger markets in general.\\\\48\\\\ additionally, some commenters suggested that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement would encourage certain companies to enter the public markets.\\\\49\\\\ \\\\46\\\\ see, e.g., letters from andersen, clsa, concert, icba, and nasba. \\\\47\\\\ see, e.g., letters from icba and nasba. \\\\48\\\\ see letter from bio. \\\\49\\\\ see, e.g., letters from advamed, advamed et al., broadmark, cerecor, and icba. conversely, other commenters asserted that the proposed amendments would not enhance capital formation, and some indicated they could even reduce capital formation.\\\\50\\\\ two of these commenters expressed the view that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement could increase the cost of capital for certain issuers because investors would require a premium to invest in issuers due to the heightened risk of ineffective internal controls.\\\\51\\\\ in addition, some commenters maintained that the icfr auditor attestation requirement does not prevent companies from entering the public markets.\\\\52\\\\ for example, one commenter suggested that the proposing release's statement about the significant decline in the number of issuers listed on major exchanges implied that the cost of compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement has contributed materially to that decline.\\\\53\\\\ this commenter and some others asserted that the decline can be attributed to many other factors.\\\\54\\\\ some commenters stated that confidence in the you.s. capital market system, likely stems, at least in part, from financial reporting safeguards, including the icfr auditor attestation requirement, and contended that the proposed amendments would thereby reduce investor confidence in issuers' financial reporting.\\\\55\\\\ \\\\50\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cii, cfa, cfa inst., and prof. ge et al. \\\\51\\\\ see letters from better markets and cfa. \\\\52\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., cii, and crowe. \\\\53\\\\ see letter from cfa. \\\\54\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cii, cfa, cfa inst., and crowe. other factors commenters cited include the expansion of exemptions to registration that increase companies' ability to raise funds privately, see, e.g., letters from cfa, cii, and crowe; corporate consolidations, see, e.g., letters from cfa and cii; market conditions, see letter from cfa; and the general regulatory environment, see letter from crowe. \\\\55\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq and cii. several commenters indicated that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is not necessary because issuers are permitted to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation if they believe it is in their interest to do so.\\\\56\\\\ some instances in which commenters suggested that issuers may choose to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation include when their investors demand it,\\\\57\\\\ when not obtaining it would have a negative impact on investment analysts' coverage,\\\\58\\\\ or when issuers otherwise deem it a good use of their capital resources.\\\\59\\\\ in this regard, one commenter suggested clarifying that it is the authority and responsibility of the issuer's audit committee to determine whether the issuer should voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\60\\\\ \\\\56\\\\ see, e.g., letters from asa, bio, broadmark, chamber, guaranty, and nasdaq. \\\\57\\\\ see, e.g., letters from bio and guaranty. \\\\58\\\\ see letter from guaranty. \\\\59\\\\ id. \\\\60\\\\ see letter from ey. c. comments on the proposed amendments' effect on investor protection commenters' views as to the effect of the proposed amendments on investor protection were also mixed. many commenters asserted that, even if the icfr auditor attestation requirement did not apply, other existing requirements would provide investors in these issuers with sufficient protection.\\\\61\\\\ commenters cited a number of these other requirements, including sox section 404(a); \\\\62\\\\ nasdaq's listing standards, surveillance, and enforcement; \\\\63\\\\ the required management certifications; \\\\64\\\\ and the obligation of an independent auditor to consider icfr when conducting a financial statement audit.\\\\65\\\\ \\\\61\\\\ see, e.g., letters from asa, broadmark, bsc, carver, cerecor, guaranty, icba, msb, nam, nasdaq, pieris, scba, and xenon. \\\\62\\\\ see, e.g., letters from asa, broadmark, carver, icba, msb, nasdaq, and xenon. \\\\63\\\\ see letter from nasdaq. \\\\64\\\\ see 17 cfr 229.601(31)(i), 17 cfr 240.13a-14(a), and 17 cfr 240.15d-14(a). see, e.g., letters from msb, nasdaq, and xenon. \\\\65\\\\ see, e.g., letters from asa, carver, cerecor, msb, nam, and xenon. for example, several commenters noted that, when conducting a financial statement audit, the auditor is required to obtain an understanding of each component of icfr,\\\\66\\\\ which a few of these commenters asserted would provide investors with sufficient protection absent the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\67\\\\ other commenters noted that the requirement that an auditor communicate to the issuer's management and its audit committee any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses related to icfr in a financial statement audit would provide a certain level of protection for investors in the affected issuers.\\\\68\\\\ some commenters expressed a view that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is not important or material to investors generally.\\\\69\\\\ a few of these commenters asserted that investors rarely ask an issuer that is exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement to voluntarily obtain such an attestation.\\\\70\\\\ one commenter \\\\71\\\\ cited a study \\\\72\\\\ that found no statistically significant market response on average to disclosures of material weaknesses in disclosure controls, which suggests, according to the commenter, that investors do not significantly change their long-term value assessment of an issuer based on these disclosures. \\\\66\\\\ see, e.g., letters from asa, caq, cfa inst., crowe, ey, grant thornton, guaranty, nasba, nasdaq, pricewaterhousecoopers llp (july 25, 2019) (``pwc''), and rsm. \\\\67\\\\

corvus, cymabay, equillium, evoke, gritstone, kezar, marinus, millendo, organovo, pieris, revance, si-bone, syros, teligent, and zynerba. some of these commenters and others asserted that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is not material for, or important to, investors based on the results of a study and their own experience. see, e.g., letters from adamas, ardelyx, catalyst, chiasma, corvus, cymabay, equillium, evoke, gritstone, kezar, marinus, millendo, organovo, pieris, revance, si-bone, syros, teligent, and zynerba (citing craig lewis and joshua white, science or compliance:

the characteristics of those weaknesses under section 302 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 (march 2008), available at . in addition to these broader points, several commenters in the banking sector pointed out that community banks and bank holding companies are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state banking regulators, which they stated would protect investors in this industry even if the affected issuers were not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\73\\\\ \\\\73\\\\ see, e.g., letters from bsc, guaranty, icba, and scba. conversely, other commenters asserted that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is an important investor protection and that eliminating it would undermine such protection.\\\\74\\\\ one commenter disputed the contention in the proposing release that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement for low-revenue issuers would not significantly affect the ability of investors to make informed investment decisions.\\\\75\\\\ some commenters stated that the icfr auditor attestation requirement increases investor confidence generally \\\\76\\\\ and that investors view the requirement as beneficial.\\\\77\\\\ \\\\74\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, grant thornton, and prof. barth et al. \\\\75\\\\ see letter from prof. barth et al. \\\\76\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, caq, cfa inst., and ey. \\\\77\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cii, cfa inst., and ey. some commenters asserted that the sox section 404(a) requirement would not provide investors in low-revenue srcs with sufficient protection if they were not also subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement \\\\78\\\\ because, as one commenter stated, the icfr auditor attestation requirement acts as

different from that of an integrated audit as it relates to icfr.\\\\83\\\\ therefore, some commenters asserted that, without the icfr auditor attestation requirement, the requirement for auditors to obtain an understanding of each component of icfr when conducting a financial statement audit would not provide sufficient investor protection.\\\\84\\\\ similarly, other commenters suggested that some testing of icfr conducted as part of a financial statement audit would not provide sufficient investor protection.\\\\85\\\\ one commenter asserted that the control testing performed by a financial statement auditor would not be as extensive as testing performed in an icfr auditor attestation and that it is more difficult for a financial statement auditor to challenge the design of icfr.\\\\86\\\\ another commenter noted that, despite the requirement that a financial statement auditor communicate any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses related to icfr to the issuer's management and its audit committee, a financial statement audit is not designed to identify such significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.\\\\87\\\\ \\\\82\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa

reliability of key performance indicators and other measures. one commenter indicated that investors in certain issuers that would become non-accelerated filers under the amendments rely on key performance indicators that are derived from their financial statements, such as backlog, sales orders, and number of customers, and asserted that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement could reduce the reliability of those indicators.\\\\98\\\\ another commenter noted that investors in those issuers rely on non- gaap financial measures, key performance indicators, and other

of these commenters noted that icfr auditor attestations have become less expensive and more effective because auditors are more experienced in conducting them.\\\\109\\\\ some commenters stated that potential compliance cost reductions may be negated if there is a loss of investor confidence and protection,\\\\110\\\\ if icfr deficiencies go undetected,\\\\111\\\\ if there is an increase in restatements and misstatements,\\\\112\\\\ or if there are higher costs of capital.\\\\113\\\\ additionally, some commenters stated that any cost reductions would vary widely among issuers \\\\114\\\\

the icfr auditor attestation requirement are not as great for low-revenue and smaller issuers as they are for other issuers.\\\\116\\\\ these commenters expressed the view that the issuers that would be exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement under the proposed amendments are less likely to have ineffective icfr than other issuers. one commenter cited a study that concluded that biotech egcs are less likely to have ineffective icfr than other issuers.\\\\117\\\\ another commenter noted that ineffective icfr is less of a concern for banking issuers because of the ``federal and

note that the bio study investigates only the incremental effect of being in the category of biotech egcs after accounting for the association of ineffective icfr with the other characteristics of these issuers (such as their size and return on assets). it is unclear from the study whether these issuers have a higher or lower rate of ineffective icfr on average, when considering all of their characteristics. \\\\118\\\\ see letter from guaranty. conversely, a number of other commenters contended that the benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement are greater for low-revenue and

variety of other comments on the proposing release. some commenters noted that it is difficult for investors to easily determine whether an issuer's filing includes an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\138\\\\ these commenters suggested requiring issuers to disclose whether they are exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement \\\\139\\\\ andor have voluntarily obtained an icfr auditor attestation \\\\140\\\\ either on a filing's cover page,\\\\141\\\\ such as with a check box,\\\\142\\\\ or in management's report on icfr.\\\\143\\\\ two commenters recommended that the commission engage in a post-implementation review of the impact of the final amendments,\\\\144\\\\ with one of these commenters recommending that the final amendments require a review of the impact of the changes on the affected registrants five years after adoption of the amendments.\\\\145\\\\ some commenters requested that we allow sufficient time and notice for auditors and issuers to prepare for compliance with the final amendments,\\\\146\\\\ whereas other commenters noted that some issuers may be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement for only a short time \\\\147\\\\ and requested the commission adopt final amendments quickly.\\\\148\\\\ one commenter asserted that the measurement date for non-accelerated filer status and the timing of the start of the auditor's attestation of icfr is burdensome to small biotech registrants.\\\\149\\\\ \\\\138\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq, cfa inst., and grant thornton. \\\\139\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa

public float for both src status and accelerated and large accelerated filer status is measured on the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and revenue for purposes of determining src status is measured based on annual revenues for the most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of the second fiscal quarter. therefore, an issuer will be aware of any change in src status or accelerated or large accelerated filer status as of that date. although an issuer that determines it will no longer be eligible to be an src is permitted to continue to use the src accommodations for the form 10-k for the year in which it fails the measurement test, an issuer that becomes an accelerated or large accelerated filer on that same measurement date would be required to include the icfr auditor attestation in that form 10-k. see rule 12b-2, item 10(f)(2)(i)(c), and rule 405. although the transition provisions apply differently, the measurement dates for src status and accelerated and large accelerated filer status each provide an issuer with at least six months to prepare for a change in its status, and we continue to believe that this is an adequate amount of time to prepare for the transition. additionally, although we did not propose amendments to the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions that would specifically address foreign private issuers (``fpi'') or business development companies (``bdc''), we solicited comment on these points and a few commenters requested we do so.\\\\150\\\\ one commenter asserted that there should be no disparity between an fpi that presents its financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards (``ifrs'') and a domestic issuer or fpi that presents its financial statements in accordance with you.s. gaap.\\\\151\\\\ the commenter noted that an fpi that presents its financial statements in accordance with ifrs cannot be an src, so such an fpi cannot rely on the proposed amendments. another commenter recommended that the commission extend the benefits of non-accelerated filer status to bdcs if they have total investment income of less than $80 million in their most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and have either no public float or public float of less than $700 million.\\\\152\\\\ the commenter stated that allowing bdcs to qualify as non-accelerated filers under this modified src revenue test would reduce regulatory asymmetry between bdcs and operating companies, consistent with recent congressional mandates to allow bdcs to use the same offering rules as operating companies. the commenter also suggested that allowing smaller bdcs to benefit from non-accelerated filer status would ease regulatory costs and burdens, which could encourage more bdcs to enter public markets, creating greater access to capital for small operating companies and expanding investment opportunities for retail investors.\\\\153\\\\ \\\\150\\\\ see, e.g., letters from dorsey & whitney llp (august 16, 2019) (``dorsey & whitney'') and proskauer rose

adopting the final amendments substantially as proposed. the final amendments add a new condition to the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2 that excludes an issuer that is eligible to be an src and that had annual revenues of less than $100 million in the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. the amendments also allow bdcs to qualify for this exclusion if they meet the requirements of the src revenue test using their annual investment income as the measure of annual revenue, although bdcs would continue to be ineligible to be srcs.\\\\154\\\\ the final amendments are consistent with our historical practice of providing scaled disclosure and other accommodations for smaller issuers \\\\155\\\\ and with recent actions by congress to reduce burdens on new and smaller issuers.\\\\156\\\\ the table below summarizes the conditions required to be considered an accelerated and large accelerated filer under the final amendments to rule 12b-2. \\\\154\\\\ see section ii.b.3.f. below. \\\\155\\\\ see, e.g., smaller reporting company regulatory relief and simplification, release no. 33-8876 (december 19, 2007) [73 fr

requirements of exchange act section 13(a) or 15(d) for a period of at least twelve calendar months. the issuer has filed at least one annual same. report pursuant exchange act section 13(a) or 15(d). the issuer is not eligible to use the same. requirements for srcs under the revenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(b), as applicable, of the ``smaller reporting company'' definition in rule 12b-2 or, in the case of a bdc, does not meet the requirements of the revenue test in those paragraphs using annual investment income as the measure of its annual revenues. below we discuss specific aspects of the final amendments about which we received significant public comment and our response to those comments. in many cases, our responses reflect analysis and data that is more comprehensively presented in the economic analysis.\\\\157\\\\ \\\\157\\\\ see section iv. below. a. using revenue for determining accelerated and large accelerated filer status as discussed above,\\\\158\\\\ several commenters supported the use of revenue in the proposal, providing a variety of reasons that a revenue measurement is preferable to using a public float measurement.\\\\159\\\\ others, however, questioned whether revenue is an appropriate measure for determining whether an issuer should be considered a non- accelerated filer.\\\\160\\\\ one of these commenters asserted that low- revenue issuers may have less sophisticated or experienced accounting functions and some aspects of their business may be associated with accounting complexities.\\\\161\\\\ also, the commenter suggested that these issuers may recognize revenue in ways that could result in them frequently transitioning in and out of non-accelerated filer status.\\\\162\\\\ \\\\158\\\\ see section ii.a.2.a. above. \\\\159\\\\ see, e.g., letters from broadmark, chamber, concert, corvus, and msb. \\\\160\\\\ see, e.g., letters from ey and grant thornton, and nasba. \\\\161\\\\ see letter from ey. \\\\162\\\\ id. as we discuss in more detail below,\\\\163\\\\ we continue to believe, as a general matter, that there may be greater costs and relatively lower benefits to including low-revenue issuers, as compared to other issuers, in the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions. while we recognize that the circumstances of individual issuers and their accounting systems and processes may vary, we believe that low- revenue issuers may, on average, be less susceptible to the risk of certain types of restatements, such as those related to revenue recognition.\\\\164\\\\ we also note that the revisions to the transition thresholds included in the final amendments may help minimize the risk of frequent reclassifications of issuer status.\\\\165\\\\ for these reasons, we continue to believe that revenue is an appropriate measure for determining whether an issuer should be considered a non-accelerated filer. \\\\163\\\\ see sections ii.b.3.d. and section iv.c.2.d. below. \\\\164\\\\ see section iv.c.3. below. \\\\165\\\\ see section ii.c. below. b. effect on capital formation and the number of public companies under the final amendments, an issuer that is eligible to be an src and that meets the src revenue test will not be required to comply with accelerated or large accelerated filer requirements and, thereby, will not be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. not subjecting these affected issuers to the icfr auditor attestation requirement should reduce their compliance costs. as discussed in the economic analysis,\\\\166\\\\ we estimate that, consistent with the proposal, an issuer no longer subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement would save approximately $210,000 per year comprised of approximately $110,000 per year reduction in audit fees and an additional reduction in non-audit costs of approximately $100,000. \\\\166\\\\ see section iv.c.2.b. below. some commenters stated that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement would enhance capital formation or allow those issuers to preserve capital.\\\\167\\\\ we note, however, that a number of other commenters asserted that these cost savings would be small,\\\\168\\\\ and may not help capital formation.\\\\169\\\\ as we discuss in the economic analysis,\\\\170\\\\ we continue to believe that the expected savings are likely to represent a meaningful cost savings for many of the affected issuers and, therefore, may have a positive effect on capital preservation and formation. although the average annual cost savings may represent a small percentage of the average affected issuer's revenues and market capitalization, we believe those savings may be meaningful given that affected issuers have, on average, negative net income and negative net cash flows from operations.\\\\171\\\\ more generally, low-revenue issuers are likely to face financing constraints because they do not have access to internally generated capital.\\\\172\\\\ therefore, the average savings of $210,000 per year for these issuers may be put to productive use \\\\173\\\\ such as developing the company.\\\\174\\\\ \\\\167\\\\ see, e.g., letters from andersen, clsa, concert, icba, and nasba. \\\\168\\\\ see letters from cfa, cfa inst., cii, and prof. barth et al. \\\\169\\\\ see note 50 above. \\\\170\\\\ see section iv.c.2.d. below. \\\\171\\\\ see note 362 below. \\\\172\\\\ this information is based on staff analysis of data from compustat. see section iv.c.2.d. below. \\\\173\\\\ for example, in a survey of issuers in the biotech industry, among 11 biotech egcs that responded to a question regarding how an extension of the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement would affect them given the costs associated with the requirement, eight out of the 11 issuers indicated that they expected a positive impact on investments in research and development and six out of the 11 issuers indicated that they expected a positive impact on hiring employees. see bio study, note 423 above. \\\\174\\\\ see, e.g., letters from adamas, aequor, andersen, ardelyx, catalyst, chiasma, clsa, concert, corvus, cymabay, dar[eacute], evoke, equillium, gritstone, icba, kezar, marinus, millendo, nasba, organovo, pieris, revance, si-bone, sutro, syros, teligent, and zynerba. as we noted in the proposing release,\\\\175\\\\ the affected issuers are a type of smaller issuer whose representation in public markets has decreased relative to the years before sox. over the past two decades, the number of issuers listed on major exchanges has decreased by about 40 percent,\\\\176\\\\ but the decline has been concentrated among smaller size issuers. for example, the number of listed issuers with a market capitalization below $700 million has decreased by about 65 percent,\\\\177\\\\ and the number of issuers with less than $100 million in revenue has decreased by about 60 percent.\\\\178\\\\ although factors other than the icfr auditor attestation requirement may have contributed to the decline,\\\\179\\\\ we believe that the described cost reductions associated with the final amendments could be a positive factor in encouraging additional small companies to register their securities offerings or a class of their securities, which would provide an increased level of transparency and investor protection with respect to those companies.\\\\180\\\\ \\\\175\\\\ see section iii.c.1. of the proposing release, note 4 above. staff extracted information regarding whether issuers reported having securities registered under section

broadmark, cerecor, and icba. c. effect on investor protection we continue to believe that the amendments are not likely to have a significant effect on the overall ability of investors in the affected issuers to make informed investment decisions and note that many commenters agreed with this assessment.\\\\181\\\\ as discussed in greater detail in the proposing release,\\\\182\\\\ issuers have a number of other obligations that we believe will provide sufficient protections for investors in the affected issuers and allow investors in those issuers to make informed investment decisions. these responsibilities derive from the foreign corrupt practices act (``fcpa'') requirements with respect to internal accounting controls \\\\183\\\\ as well as a number of different changes to financial reporting that were introduced by sox.\\\\184\\\\ \\\\181\\\\ see note 61 to 68 above and accompanying text. \\\\182\\\\ see section ii.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\183\\\\ the fcpa added section 13(b)(2)(b) to the exchange act, 15 you.s.c 78m(b)(2)(b) (referring to ``internal accounting controls'' rather than icfr). \\\\184\\\\ see, e.g., sox sections 302, 15 you.s.c. 7241, and 404(a) and related rules. see 17 cfr 229.308, 17 cfr 240.13a-15, 17 cfr 240.15d-15, form 20-f, form 40-f, 17 cfr 270.30a-2, and 17 cfr 270.30a-3. for example, although a non-accelerated filer that is eligible to be an src and that meets the src revenue test will not be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, it will remain subject to the sox section 404(a) requirement to state in its annual report the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate control structure and procedures for financial reporting, and for that report to contain an assessment of the effectiveness of that structure and its procedures. in addition, affected issuers are required to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap.\\\\185\\\\ also, the principal executive and financial officers of certain issuers are required to certify that, among other things, they are responsible for establishing and maintaining icfr, have designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure material information relating to the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to such officers by others within those entities, and have evaluated and reported on the effectiveness of the issuer's disclosure controls and procedures.\\\\186\\\\ \\\\185\\\\ 15 you.s.c. 78m(b)(2)(b). \\\\186\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.13a-14 or 17 cfr 240.15d-14 (requiring certification) and 17 cfr 229.601(b)(31) (prescribing certification content). these rules were adopted pursuant to sox section 302. see 15 you.s.c. 7241. furthermore, the issuers that are subject to the final amendments will remain subject to a financial statement audit by an independent auditor, which will help maintain appropriate investor protections. even without an icfr auditor attestation requirement, an independent auditor is required to consider icfr in the performance of a financial statement audit.\\\\187\\\\ we acknowledge, as stated by some commenters,\\\\188\\\\ that the objective of a financial statement audit and the level of control testing performed is different from an icfr audit. however, we believe that the requirements of a financial statement audit, among other requirements, provide some additional protections and that, for low-revenue srcs, this and the other protections and factors associated with these issuers described above sufficiently mitigate the risk that the final amendments will adversely affect the ability of investors to make informed investment decisions.\\\\189\\\\ \\\\187\\\\ see public company accounting oversight board (``pcaob'') accounting standard (``as'') 2110, identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement, paragraphs .18 through .40 (``pcaob as 2110''), paragraphs .18 through .40. \\\\188\\\\ see note 83 above. \\\\189\\\\ see section iv.c.3.b. below (stating that, in the proposing release, note 4 above, we noted that low-revenue issuers may be less likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose material weaknesses in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation, perhaps because they have less complex financial systems and controls). for example, the auditor in a financial statement audit is required to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements, which is similar to the risk assessment evaluation required in an icfr auditor attestation. additionally, the auditor engaged in a financial statement audit often may test the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls even if not performing an integrated audit to reduce the extent of substantive testing required to issue an opinion on the financial statements. moreover, even if an auditor decides not to rely on internal controls to reduce the extent of substantive testing, the auditor may still identify internal control deficiencies during such substantive testing in a financial statement audit. under pcaob standards, the evaluation and communication of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in icfr to management and the issuer's audit committee is required in both a financial statement audit and an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\190\\\\ the evaluation of the severity of a control deficiency identified by the auditor is the same for a financial statement audit and an icfr auditor attestation. further, a financial statement auditor has the responsibility to review management's disclosure for any misstatement of facts, such as a statement that icfr is effective when there is a known material weakness.\\\\191\\\\ therefore, we continue to believe significant deficiencies and material weaknesses that an icfr auditor attestation may uncover also may be uncovered as a part of the financial statement audit of a low-revenue src. as discussed above,\\\\192\\\\ because of these requirements, a number of commenters agreed that an auditor of the financial statements of a low-revenue issuer that would be exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement under the final amendments would still be required to consider icfr and therefore this process would provide sufficient investor protection. \\\\190\\\\ see section ii.c. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\191\\\\ id. \\\\192\\\\ see notes 61 to 68 above and accompanying text. other developments may serve to reinforce these existing investor protections. in 2010, the pcaob adopted enhanced auditing standards related to the auditor's assessment of, and response to, risk that, in part, clarify and augment the extent to which internal controls are to be considered in a financial statement audit.\\\\193\\\\ in particular, these risk assessment standards require auditors in both an integrated and financial statement audit to evaluate the design of certain controls.\\\\194\\\\ the pcaob has expressed concern about the number and significance of deficiencies in auditing firm compliance with these risk assessment auditing standards, but it has also noted promising improvements in their application.\\\\195\\\\ \\\\193\\\\ see auditing standards related to the auditor's assessment of and response to risk and related amendments to pcaob standards, pcaob release no. 2010-004 (august 5, 2010) (``pcaob release no. 2010- 004''). see also public company accounting oversight board; order approving proposed rules on auditing standards related to the auditor's assessment of and response to

standards are discussed in further detail in the economic analysis. see section iv.b.1. below. \\\\194\\\\ see as 2110, paragraphs .18 through .40, note 187 above. \\\\195\\\\ see inspection

recent settled charges against four public companies for failing to maintain effective icfr for seven to 10 consecutive annual reporting periods \\\\196\\\\ may have a deterrent effect on issuers failing to remediate material weaknesses, which could reduce the overall rate of persistence of material weaknesses in icfr. also, if management elects to obtain and use automated controls testing and process automation,\\\\197\\\\ this may result in improvements in icfr regardless of the icfr auditor attestation requirement if their increased application results in more robust financial reporting with fewer opportunities for icfr deficiencies and or in an increase by management in their testing and related improvements of controls. in section iv.c.3.b.5, we note, as an example, that issuers may have made investments in systems, procedures, or training to explain how control improvements may persist for certain affected issuers. finally, we note that auditors have had many years of experience with the 2010 risk assessment standards, and therefore auditors may be more likely to test icfr, even if an icfr auditor attestation is not required, as a means of enhancing auditing efficiency.\\\\198\\\\ \\\\196\\\\ see sec charges four public companies with longstanding icfr failures, press release (january 29,2019) (``sec press release''), available at . \\\\197\\\\ see, e.g.,

for example, a robotic process automation program can be ``set up to automatically match purchase orders, invoices, and shipping documents [and] can check that the price and quantity on each of the

auditor is more likely to continue to test them even if [it is] not issuing an auditor attestation during a particular year in order to rely on them for purposes of reducing substantive testing in the audit of the financial statements, particularly for issuers that are larger and more complex''). we recognize that some commenters disagreed with this assessment and asserted that investor protections other than the icfr auditor attestation requirement would not be sufficient because, among other reasons, a financial statement audit has a different objective than an integrated audit,\\\\199\\\\ testing of icfr in a financial statement audit is not as extensive,\\\\200\\\\ it is more difficult for a financial statement auditor to challenge the design of icfr,\\\\201\\\\ and a financial statement audit is not designed to identify significant icfr deficiencies or material weaknesses.\\\\202\\\\ as discussed in the economic analysis, we acknowledge that the amendments may be associated with some adverse effects on the effectiveness of icfr and the reliability of financial statements for the affected issuers.\\\\203\\\\ however, the proposing release presented evidence that suggests that these effects and their impact on investor protection are likely to be mitigated in the case of the affected issuers as compared to other accelerated filers. the economic analysis provides further related analysis in response to commenter feedback and does not find evidence that leads us to alter this view.\\\\204\\\\ \\\\199\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq, cfa inst., and rsm. \\\\200\\\\ see letter from ey. \\\\201\\\\ id. \\\\202\\\\ id. \\\\203\\\\ see section iv.a. below. \\\\204\\\\ id. one commenter indicated that a low-revenue issuer could have a large market capitalization and thus ``greater investor exposure.'' \\\\205\\\\ as discussed in the economic analysis,\\\\206\\\\ we agree that, as capitalization increases, there is more investor capital at risk. we note, however, that relative to higher-revenue issuers, on average, risk among these issuers is likely more associated with their future prospects than their current financial statements.\\\\207\\\\ therefore, exempting low-revenue issuers from the icfr auditor attestation requirement is less likely to affect investor protections with respect to those issuers. \\\\205\\\\ see letter from grant thornton. \\\\206\\\\ see section iv.c.3.d. below. \\\\207\\\\ also, the affected parties are limited to issuers with no more than $700 million in public float. further, as discussed in section iv.c.3.d below, we estimate that in aggregate the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements represent 0.2 percent of the total equity market capitalization of issuers. one commenter noted its concern that certain issuers that would no longer be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement are conducting large initial public offerings (``ipos'') based on key performance indicators that are derived from financial systems, and that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement could result in potentially less robust internal controls and unreliable data.\\\\208\\\\ to the extent the commenter is primarily concerned with the information available to investors at the time of an ipo, we note that the affected issuers that would be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement are generally more mature firms that are not within five years of their ipo. \\\\208\\\\ see letter from nasba. also, we believe the risk for those low-revenue issuers for which key performance indicators are material to investors and that are derived from financial systems is mitigated by the requirement to maintain, evaluate, and disclose effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures \\\\209\\\\ on a quarterly basis.\\\\210\\\\ key performance indicators or non-gaap measures disclosed within a report filed or submitted to the commission generally are within the scope of disclosure controls and procedures. the financial systems from which an issuer derives the key performance indicator or non-gaap measure would normally be included in icfr and, therefore, within the scope of management's assessments as well. further, the commission recently issued disclosure guidance on key performance indicators and metrics and reminded issuers of the importance of effective controls and procedures when disclosing material key performance indicators or metrics that are derived from their own information.\\\\211\\\\ \\\\209\\\\ although there is substantial overlap between an issuer's disclosure controls and procedures and icfr, there are elements of each that are not subsumed by the other. see 17 cfr 240.13a-15 and 17 cfr 240.15d-15. \\\\210\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.13a-14 and 17 cfr 240.15d-14. \\\\211\\\\ see commission guidance on management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, release no. 34-88094 (january 30, 2020). d. disproportionate costs and benefits of the icfr auditor attestation for small and low-revenue companies not only is the icfr auditor attestation requirement costly in general, as discussed above, a number of commenters asserted that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is disproportionally costly to small and low-revenue issuers.\\\\212\\\\ we agree that the costs of the icfr auditor attestation requirement may be particularly burdensome for these issuers because they include fixed costs that are not scalable for smaller issuers, as also noted by several commenters.\\\\213\\\\ further, low-revenue issuers have limited access to internally generated capital, and so the costs may more directly impact their ability to spend on investments or hiring.\\\\214\\\\ we therefore expect that reducing these costs would have a more beneficial impact on small and low- revenue issuers than it would for other issuers. some commenters similarly expressed the view that the amendments would enhance these issuers' ability to preserve capital without significantly affecting the ability of investors to make informed investment decisions based on the financial reporting of those issuers.\\\\215\\\\ \\\\212\\\\ see note 102 above and accompanying text. \\\\213\\\\ see letters from asa, broadmark, chamber, and guaranty. \\\\214\\\\ see, e.g., letters from dar[eacute], summit and xenon. \\\\215\\\\ see letters from andersen, clsa, concert, icba, and nasba. as discussed above, other commenters claimed that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement would not substantially reduce costs to issuers \\\\216\\\\ and that there would be other negative impacts of this change.\\\\217\\\\ we acknowledge that the magnitude of these cost savings likely will vary among issuers depending upon their particular facts and circumstances \\\\218\\\\ and, as some commenters asserted,\\\\219\\\\ icfr auditor attestations have become less expensive over time because auditors are more experienced in conducting them. however, based on the comments received and our own analysis of available data,\\\\220\\\\ we believe the cost reductions from not being subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement could be substantial for affected issuers. \\\\216\\\\ see note 108 above and accompanying text. \\\\217\\\\ see notes 110 to 113 above and accompanying text. \\\\218\\\\ see, e.g., letters from ey, grant thornton, and pwc. \\\\219\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa inst. and deloitte. \\\\220\\\\ see section iv.c.2.d. we believe the benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement likely are fewer for low-revenue srcs than for other issuers, an assessment supported by some commenters.\\\\221\\\\ as a result, obtaining the icfr auditor attestation is likely, on average, to be less meaningful for these issuers, and not obtaining one should have less of an impact on investor protection than for other types of issuers. first, we note that low-revenue srcs may be less susceptible to the risk of certain kinds of misstatements, such as those related to revenue recognition. as discuss in the economic analysis,\\\\222\\\\ 10 to 20 percent of restatements and about 60 percent of financial disclosure fraud cases in recent times have been associated with improper revenue recognition,\\\\223\\\\ which is less of a risk, for example, for issuers that currently have little to no revenue. \\\\221\\\\ see notes 116 to 118 above and accompanying text. \\\\222\\\\ see section iv.c.3. below. \\\\223\\\\ see audit analytics, 2017 financial restatements: a seventeen year comparison, (may 2018), and committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway

(``coso 2010 fraud study''), available at . second, as we noted in table 14 of the proposing release,\\\\224\\\\ issuers with revenues of less than $100 million have, on average, restatement rates that are three to nine percentage points lower than those for higher-revenue issuers. moreover, certain low-revenue srcs likely have less complex financial systems and controls and, therefore, may be less likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose material weaknesses in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation. \\\\224\\\\ see section iii.c.4.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. third, we believe that those issuers' financial statements may be less critical to assessing their valuation given, for example, the relative importance of their future prospects. we recognize that other commenters disagreed and asserted that benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement are greater for lower-revenue and smaller issuers than for other issuers.\\\\225\\\\ we carefully considered these comments and, as discussed in the economic analysis, investigated the claims by conducting supplemental analysis, but we did not find evidence that led us to alter our views.\\\\226\\\\ \\\\225\\\\ see notes 119 to 124 above and accompanying text. \\\\226\\\\ see section iv.c.3.a. below. e. relationship between non-accelerated filers and srcs under the final amendments, some, but not all, srcs would become non-accelerated filers. we are not adopting an alternative suggested by some commenters of fully aligning the src and non-accelerated filer definitions. as we note in the economic analysis,\\\\227\\\\ although full alignment of the two definitions could provide several benefits, including greater regulatory simplicity, reducing any frictions or confusion associated with issuers' determination of their filer status or reporting regime, and expanding the number of issuers that qualify as non-accelerated filers, fully aligning the two definitions also could result in costs that are greater than those for the amendments we are adopting. for example, the mitigating factors associated with exempting low-revenue issuers, such as a potential lower susceptibility to the risks of certain kinds of misstatements and a greater role of future prospects relative to current financial statements in driving market valuations for these issuers as compared to other issuers,\\\\228\\\\ may not be present or may be more limited, for other types of srcs. \\\\227\\\\ see section iv.c.5.a. below. \\\\228\\\\ see section iv.c.3. below. as a result, fully aligning the src and non-accelerated filer thresholds could have adverse effects on the reliability of the financial statements of the issuers with higher revenues and the ability of investors to make informed investment decisions about those issuers.\\\\229\\\\ therefore, we do not believe it would be appropriate at this time to increase the public float threshold for non-accelerated filers to align that definition with the src definition. additionally, we note that many non-accelerated filers remain eligible for the jobs act exemption for their first five years as a public company. the table below summarizes the relationships between srcs and non-accelerated and accelerated filers under the final amendments. \\\\229\\\\ id. table 2relationships between srcs and

circumstances that are analogous to the exclusions for other issuers under the amendments. the amendments include a specific provision applicable to bdcs, because bdcs are not eligible to be srcs and to provide a definition of ``revenue'' for bdcs to use for this purpose.\\\\230\\\\ specifically, a bdc will be excluded from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2 if the bdc: (1) has a public float of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million; and (2) has investment income of less than $100 million.\\\\231\\\\ the amendments to rule 12b-2 provide that, for this purpose, a bdc's revenue is the bdc's investment income, as defined in rule 6-07.1 of regulation s-x.\\\\232\\\\ bdcs are subject to the same transition provisions for accelerated filer and large accelerated status that apply to other issuers under the amendments, except that the amendments' bdc-specific ``revenue'' definition will apply to these transition provisions as well.\\\\233\\\\ \\\\230\\\\ although a bdc is considered to be eligible to use the requirements for srcs under the revenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(b) of the ``smaller reporting company'' definition in rule 12b-2 for purposes of the amended accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions, bdcs will continue to be ineligible to be srcs under the final amendments. \\\\231\\\\ see paragraphs (1)(iv), (2)(iv), and (4) of the amended definitions of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer in rule 12b-2. consistent with the current definitions of these terms, a bdc with public float of less than $75 million is already a non- accelerated filer, regardless of the amount of its annual investment income. \\\\232\\\\ see 17 cfr 210.6-07.1. \\\\233\\\\ see section ii.c. below (discussing the amended transition provisions more generally). although the commission did not propose to exclude bdcs from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions using the src revenue test, the commission did solicit comment on such an approach and discussed the relative costs and benefits of this alternative in the proposing release.\\\\234\\\\ in response, one commenter urged that we adopt such an approach, stating that, among other reasons, the policy reasons that support providing regulatory relief to smaller reporting companies should apply equally to smaller bdcs.\\\\235\\\\ this commenter suggested that the commission expand the proposed amendment to the definition of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer to exclude bdcs with total investment income of less than $80 million in the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and either no public float or public float of less than $700 million. \\\\234\\\\ see sections ii.c., ii.e., and iii.c.6. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\235\\\\ see letter from proskauer. although we observed in the proposing release that the src revenue test would not be meaningful for bdcs because bdcs prepare financial statements under article 6 of regulation s-x and generally do not report revenue, the final amendments' definition of ``revenue'' for purposes of the bdc-specific provisions incorporate information that bdcs report in their financial statements. a bdc's investment income includes income from dividends, interest on securities, and other income.\\\\236\\\\ we recognize, as stated in the proposing release, that investors in bdcs generally may place greater significance on the financial reporting of bdcs relative to low-revenue non-investment company issuers and bdc financial statements will continue to be audited by an independent auditor. as the commenter supporting this approach observed, however, the policy considerations supporting the final amendments generally apply to bdcs.\\\\237\\\\ moreover, bdcs that are excluded from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions will remain obligated, among other things, to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and have management assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. the final amendments also are consistent with other rulemaking initiatives in which we have sought to provide bdcs parity with other reporting companies in appropriate circumstances.\\\\238\\\\ \\\\236\\\\ a bdc's annual investment income is equivalent to annual revenues solely for purposes of the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions. these amendments do not affect the meaning of ``revenue'' or ``investment income'' in other commission rules or provisions of the securities laws. \\\\237\\\\ see letter from proskauer. \\\\238\\\\ see securities offering reform for closed-end investment

large accelerated filer definitions if it qualifies as an src \\\\239\\\\ under the src revenue test in exchange act rule 12b-2. one commenter asserted that the final amendments should permit an fpi that presents its financial statements using ifrs to qualify for the exemption based on the low-revenue test.\\\\240\\\\ we note that foreign issuers that qualify as fpis or srcs are permitted to avail themselves of special accommodations unique to each reporting regime, but must select one reporting regime or the other. the final amendments provide an exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement for low- revenue srcs. issuers that qualify as fpis and elect to use the fpi reporting regime have other accommodations available to them, such as the ability to disclose material changes in their icfr and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures on an annual basis, as compared to the quarterly basis required of you.s. issuers, including srcs.\\\\241\\\\

icfr auditor attestation requirement less frequently than annually. issuers that are accelerated or large accelerated filers will be required to obtain an icfr auditor attestation every year, unless they qualify as egcs, as under our current rules. we did not propose to revise this requirement, but requested comment on this matter, and every commenter that discussed the subject \\\\242\\\\ asserted that issuers that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement should obtain one annually. a few of these commenters asserted that requiring the icfr auditor attestation only once every three years would not decrease costs significantly because auditors consider prior year audit results when planning and performing the current year audit, so performing an audit of icfr every three years would reduce efficiencies gained from performing audits annually and add complexity and costs.\\\\243\\\\ also, one commenter indicated that auditors in many instances may continue to test internal controls in the financial statement audit, which potentially limits any resulting cost reduction.\\\\244\\\\ \\\\242\\\\ see, e.g., letters from crowe, kpmg, and nasba. \\\\243\\\\ see, e.g.,

issuers report whether they have obtained an icfr auditor attestation, we requested comment on whether we should do so. as discussed above,\\\\245\\\\ some commenters recommended that the final rule include a requirement for an issuer to prominently disclose in its filing whether an icfr auditor attestation is included. this type of disclosure was also recommended by the government accountability office (``gao'') in a 2013 study of internal controls requirements.\\\\246\\\\ no commenters opposed such a requirement. disclosure of the icfr auditor attestation is currently required within the auditor's report on the financial statements and management's annual report on icfr.\\\\247\\\\ after reviewing these comments, we are persuaded to add a check box to the cover pages of forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f to indicate whether an icfr auditor attestation is included in the filing because we agree that more prominent and easily accessible disclosure of this information would be useful to investors and market participants while imposing only minimal burdens on issuers. \\\\245\\\\ see notes 138 to 143 above and the accompanying text. \\\\246\\\\ see you.s. gov't accountability office,

thresholds from $50 million to $60 million and $500 million to $560 million and to add the src revenue test to the transition threshold 1. proposed amendments an issuer initially becomes an accelerated filer after it first meets certain conditions as of the end of its fiscal year, including that it had a public float of $75 million or more but less than $700 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. an issuer initially becomes a large accelerated filer in a similar manner, including that it had a public float of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. once the issuer becomes an accelerated filer, it will not become a non-accelerated filer unless it determines at the end of a fiscal year that its public float had fallen below $50 million on the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. similarly, a large accelerated filer will remain one unless its public float had fallen below $500 million on the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. if the large accelerated filer's public float falls below $500 million but is $50 million or more, it becomes an accelerated filer. alternatively, if the issuer's public float falls below $50 million, it becomes a non- accelerated filer.\\\\252\\\\ the purpose of these transition thresholds is to avoid situations in which an issuer frequently enters and exits accelerated and large accelerated filer status due to small fluctuations in its public float. \\\\252\\\\ for example, under the rules prior to these amendments, if an issuer that is a non-accelerated filer determines at the end of its fiscal year that it had a public float of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, on the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, it will become an accelerated filer. on the last business day of its next fiscal year, the issuer must re-determine its public float to re-evaluate its filer status. if the accelerated filer's public float fell to $70 million on the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, it would remain an accelerated filer because its public float did not fall below the $50 million transition threshold. alternatively, if the issuer's public float fell to $49 million, it would then become a non-accelerated filer because its newly determined public float is below $50 million. as another example, an issuer that has not been a large accelerated filer but had a public float of $700 million or more on the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter would then become a large accelerated filer at the end of its fiscal year. if, on the last business day of its subsequently completed second fiscal quarter, the issuer's public float fell to $600 million, it would remain a large accelerated filer because its public float did not fall below $500 million. if, however, the issuer's public float fell to $490 million at the end of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, it would become an accelerated filer at the end of the fiscal year because its public float fell below $500 million. similarly, if the issuer's public float fell to $49 million, the issuer would become a non-accelerated filer. in the src adopting release,\\\\253\\\\ we amended the src rules so that the src transition thresholds were set at 80 percent of the corresponding initial qualification thresholds. in the proposing release, we proposed to revise the accelerated and large accelerated filer transition thresholds to be 80 percent of the corresponding initial qualification thresholds to align the transition thresholds across the src, accelerated filer, and large accelerated filer definitions. additionally, we indicated that revising these thresholds would limit the cases in which an issuer could be both an accelerated filer and an src or a large accelerated filer and an src, thereby reducing regulatory complexity. \\\\253\\\\ see note 12 above. we proposed to revise the transition threshold for becoming a non- accelerated filer from $50 million to $60 million and the transition threshold for leaving the large accelerated filer status from $500 million to $560 million. we also proposed to add the src revenue test to the public float transition thresholds for accelerated and large accelerated filers. if the src revenue test were not added to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer transition provisions, an issuer's annual revenues would never factor into determining whether an accelerated filer could become a non-accelerated filer, or whether a large accelerated filer could become an accelerated or non-accelerated filer. we proposed that an issuer that is already an accelerated filer would remain one unless either its public float falls below $60 million or it becomes eligible to use the src accommodations under the revenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(b) of the src definition,\\\\254\\\\ as applicable.\\\\255\\\\ therefore, under the proposed amendments, an accelerated filer would remain an accelerated filer until its public float falls below $60 million or its annual revenues fall below the applicable revenue threshold ($80 million or $100 million), at which point it would become a non-accelerated filer. \\\\254\\\\ paragraph (2) of the src definition states that an issuer qualifies as an src if its annual revenues are less than $100 million and it has no public float or a public float of less than $700 million. paragraph (3)(iii)(b) of the src definition states, among other things, that an issuer that initially determines it does not qualify as an src because its annual revenues are $100 million or more cannot become an src until its annual revenues fall below $80 million. \\\\255\\\\ an issuer that is initially applying the src definition or previously qualified as an src would apply paragraph (2) of the src definition. once an issuer determines that it does not qualify for src status, it would apply paragraph (3)(iii)(b) of the src definition at its next annual determination. similarly, we proposed conforming amendments to the large accelerated filer transition provisions for when an issuer that is already a large accelerated filer transitions to either accelerated or non-accelerated filer status. to transition out of large accelerated filer status at the end of the issuer's fiscal year, an issuer would need to have a public float below $560 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or meet the revenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(b), as applicable, of the src definition. a large accelerated filer would become an accelerated filer at the end of its fiscal year if its public float fell to $60 million or more but less than $560 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter and its annual revenues are not below the applicable revenue threshold ($80 million or $100 million). the large accelerated filer would become a non-accelerated filer if its public float fell below $60 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or its annual revenues fell below the applicable revenue threshold ($80 million or $100 million).\\\\256\\\\ \\\\256\\\\ one exception to this requirement is that an issuer that was a large accelerated filer whose public float had fallen below $700 million (but remained $560 million or more) but became eligible to be an src under the src revenue test in the first year the src amendments became effective would become a non-accelerated filer even though its public float remained at or above $560 million. see src adopting release, note 12 above, at n. 31 (``for purposes of the first fiscal year ending after effectiveness of the amendments, a registrant will qualify as a src if it meets one of the initial qualification thresholds in the revised definition as of the date it is required to measure its public float or revenues (the `measurement date'), even if such registrant previously did not qualify as a src.''). 2. comments we received very few comments regarding the proposed changes to the transition thresholds. the commenters who discussed the proposed amendments to increase the public float transition thresholds supported them.\\\\257\\\\ one commenter also suggested that the commission consider indexing the thresholds to inflation in a manner similar to the indexing that applies to the egc definition.\\\\258\\\\ only two commenters addressed the proposed amendments to add the src revenue test to the transition thresholds, and these commenters supported that proposal.\\\\259\\\\ \\\\257\\\\ see, e.g., letters from clsa, nasdaq, and rsm. \\\\258\\\\ see letter from rsm. \\\\259\\\\ see letters from clsa and nasdaq. 3. final amendments after considering the comments, we are adopting the final amendments as proposed. as discussed in greater detail in the economic analysis,\\\\260\\\\ transition thresholds in rule 12b-2 are lower than entry thresholds to keep issuers from frequently needing to reclassify their filer status. the frequent reclassifications that would result without the transition thresholds may cause confusion for issuers and investors as to the issuer's status. also, such frequent reclassifications may increase issuers' costs because they would frequently need to revise their disclosure schedules and continually consider the impact of whether they are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement from one year to the next, and may increase investors' incremental costs of evaluating the reliability of the issuer's financial disclosures. therefore, we believe a transition threshold is appropriate. however, we recognize that providing a transition threshold results in some issuers remaining in their filer status even though their public float or revenues are below that filer status's entry threshold. \\\\260\\\\ see section iv.c.4.c below. the final amendments revise the public float transition threshold for accelerated and large accelerated filers to become a non- accelerated filer from $50 million to $60 million and revise the public float transition threshold for a large accelerated filer to lose its large accelerated filer status from $500 million to $560 million. prior to the final amendments, the public float threshold for an accelerated and large accelerated filer to become a non-accelerated filer was $50 million and the public float transition threshold for a large accelerated filer to lose its large accelerated filer status was $500 million. we believe these threshold amounts are too low and result in more issuers than intended being classified as an accelerated or large accelerated filer. however, we believe there should be some transition threshold so as to avoid some volatility. the amendments would make the public float transition thresholds 80 percent of the initial thresholds, which is consistent with the percentage used in the transition thresholds for src eligibility. we believe this approach appropriately balances the risk of frequent reclassifications resulting from a higher percentage threshold against the risk of delaying appropriate transitions due to a lower threshold. the table below summarizes how an issuer's filer status will change based on its subsequent public float determination. table 3subsequent determination of filer status based on public float under final amendments final amendments to the public float thresholds subsequent public float initial public float determination resulting filer status determination resulting filer status $700 million or more large accelerated filer $560 million or more large accelerated filer. less than $560 million accelerated

million or more. less than $60 million.. non-accelerated filer. the final amendments also add the src revenue test to the transition threshold for accelerated and large accelerated filers. as we noted in the proposing release, if we do not add the src revenue test to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer transition provisions, an issuer's annual revenues would never factor into determining whether an accelerated filer could become a non-accelerated filer, or whether a large accelerated filer could become an accelerated or non-accelerated filer. we note that one commenter stated that the manner in which issuers may recognize revenue could cause them to frequently lose and gain non-accelerated filer status.\\\\261\\\\ we believe that providing transition thresholds should mitigate any such concern. \\\\261\\\\ see letter from ey. under the final amendments, an accelerated filer with revenues of $100 million or more that is eligible to be an src based on the public float test contained in paragraphs (1) and (3)(iii)(a) of the src definition can transition to non-accelerated filer status in a subsequent year if it has revenues of less than $100 million. for example, an issuer with a december 31 fiscal year end that did not exceed the public float threshold in the prior year and that has a public float, as of june 30, 2020, of $230 million and annual revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 of $101 million will be eligible to be an src under the public float test; however, because the issuer would not be eligible to be an src under the src revenue test, it will be an accelerated filer (assuming the other conditions described in table 1 are also met). at the next determination date (june 30, 2021), if its public float, as of june 30, 2020, remains at $230 million and its annual revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 are less than $100 million, the issuer will be eligible to be an src under the src revenue test (in addition to the public float test) and thus it will become a non-accelerated filer. on the other hand, an issuer with a december 31 fiscal year end that has a public float, as of june 30, 2020, of $400 million and annual revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 of $101 million will not be eligible to be an src under either the public float test or the src revenue test and will be an accelerated filer (assuming the other conditions described in table 1 also are met). at the next determination date (june 30, 2021), if its public float, as of june 30, 2021, remains at $400 million, that issuer will not be eligible to be an src under the src revenue test unless its annual revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 are less than $80 million, at which point it will be eligible to be an src under the src revenue test and to become a non-accelerated filer. d. transition issues the final amendments will become effective 30 days after they are published in the federal register. the final amendments will apply to an annual report filing due on or after the effective date. even if that annual report is for a fiscal year ending before the effective date, the issuer may apply the final amendments to determine its status as a non-accelerated, accelerated, or large accelerated filer. for example, an issuer that has a march 31, 2020 fiscal year end and that is due to file its annual report after the effective date of the amendments may apply the final amendments to determine its filing status even though its fiscal year end date precedes the effective date. an issuer that determines it is eligible to be a non-accelerated filer under the final amendments will not be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement for its annual report due and submitted after the effective date of the amendments and may comply with the filing deadlines that apply, and other accommodations available, to non-accelerated filers. iii. other matters if any of the provisions of these amendments, or the application of these provisions to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application. pursuant to the congressional review act,\\\\262\\\\ the office of information and regulatory affairs has designated these amendments as not ``a major rule,'' as defined by 5 you.s.c. 804(2). \\\\262\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 801 et seq. iv. economic analysis we are mindful of the costs and benefits of the amendments. the discussion below addresses the economic effects of the amendments, including their anticipated costs and benefits, as well as the likely effects of the amendments on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.\\\\263\\\\ we also analyze the potential costs and benefits of reasonable alternatives to the amendments. where practicable, we have attempted to quantify the economic effects of the amendments; however, in certain cases, we are unable to do so because either the necessary data are unavailable or certain effects are not quantifiable. in these cases, we provide a qualitative assessment of the likely economic effects. \\\\263\\\\ section 2(b), 15 you.s.c. 77b(b), and section 3(f) of the exchange act, 15 you.s.c. 78c(f), directs the commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. further, section 23(a)(2) of the exchange act, 15 you.s.c. 78w(a)(2), requires the commission, when making rules under the exchange act, to consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act. a. introduction as discussed above, we are adopting amendments to the definitions of ``accelerated filer'' and ``large accelerated filer'' that will generally extend non-accelerated filer status to issuers with up to $700 million in public float if they are eligible to be srcs and their revenues are less than $100 million. as non-accelerated filers, among other things, these issuers will not be required to obtain an icfr auditor attestation pursuant to sox section 404(b). the amendments are intended to reduce compliance costs for these issuers while maintaining investor protections by more appropriately tailoring the types of issuers that are included in the categories of accelerated and large accelerated filers. in the proposing release, we presented evidence that the imposition of the icfr auditor attestation requirement has been associated with benefits to issuers and investors, such as reduced rates of ineffective icfr and more reliable financial statements.\\\\264\\\\ however, as explained in the proposing release, the affected issuers may find the costs of this requirement to be particularly burdensome given certain fixed costs that may not scale with size. importantly, because these issuers have limited access to internally-generated capital, savings on compliance costs may be more likely to be applied to additional investment, research, or hiring. \\\\264\\\\ see section iii.c.4.a. of the proposing release, note 4 above,. see also section iv.c.3.a. below. we acknowledged, in the proposing release, that exempting these low-revenue issuers from the icfr auditor attestation requirement may result in adverse effects such as an increased prevalence of ineffective icfr and restatements, and we estimated the potential effects on the rates of such issues among the affected issuers. at the same time, we provided evidence in support of two mitigating factors specific to the affected issuers.\\\\265\\\\ first, we documented that low-revenue issuers have relatively low rates of restatement, which could mean that the affected issuers may, on average, be less susceptible to the risk of certain kinds of misstatements. next, we provided evidence that the market value of the low-revenue issuers was not as associated with contemporary financial statements as for higher-revenue issuers, which could imply that their valuations are driven to a greater degree by their future prospects. \\\\265\\\\ we also noted in the proposing release, note 4 above, that issuers exempted from this requirement may choose to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation if investors demand it or the issuers otherwise deem it, from their perspective, to be the best use of their resources. commenters raised a number of concerns with our analysis and conclusions in the proposing release. we carefully reviewed all of the comments received and in a few instances, conducted supplemental analysis in response to the issues and questions raised by those comments. overall, based on our analysis of the available evidence and data, our primary conclusions have not substantively changed. while we address the comments in detail in the body of the economic analysis below, we highlight certain of our findings in relation to some commenter concerns here. one concern raised by commenters is that rather than targeting issuers where there may be relatively fewer benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, the amendments will remove this requirement for exactly those issuers where the benefits may be greatest.\\\\266\\\\ these commenters supported this assertion by, for example, claiming that investors react more strongly to news of restatements or material weaknesses in icfrand thus care more about the benefits of an icfr auditor attestationat small or low-revenue issuers as compared to other issuers.\\\\267\\\\ in response to these comments, we have conducted additional analyses of the investor response to icfr disclosures and restatement announcements. we do not find any evidence that investors react more negatively to restatements or to auditors reporting material weaknesses in icfr at low-revenue issuers than at higher-revenue issuers. further, based on the suggestions of a commenter,\\\\268\\\\ we have refined our analysis of the extent to which financial statement variables are associated with the valuation of different types of issuers. we continue to find that financial statement variables explain a greater amount of the variation in stock prices and returns for higher-revenue issuers than for low- revenue issuers, even when we focus on more seasoned issuers similar to those that would be affected by the amendments or when we expand the set of variables that we consider. overall, our analysis does not provide support for the assertion that investors care more about the information produced by the icfr auditor attestation requirement at low-revenue issuers than at other issuers. \\\\266\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., and cii. see also commissioner jackson's statement. \\\\267\\\\ id. \\\\268\\\\ see letter from crowe. a few commenters asserted that the costs of the amendments will significantly outweigh any benefits.\\\\269\\\\ we have conducted supplemental analysis and quantification of the potential costs of the amendments and do not find evidence to support the views of these commenters. we carefully considered the cost estimates provided by commenters and found them useful in refining our own analysis. however, we found some of these estimates to be overstated. for example, some estimates applied costs associated with a small fraction of issuers to all of the affected issuers or implicitly compared aggregate estimates of costs over multiple years to the estimated savings for a single year.\\\\270\\\\ others identified investor harms that occurred despite the icfr auditor attestation requirement being in place, which may demonstrate the limitations of the icfr auditor attestation requirement rather than informing us of the risks of removing the requirement.\\\\271\\\\ \\\\269\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets and prof. barth et al. \\\\270\\\\ see letter from prof. barth et al. (with respect to quantified benefits of icfr audit for the average company). \\\\271\\\\ see letters from better markets and prof. barth et al. (with respect to estimates of income and stock market impact of restatements). some commenters stated that the proposing release did not provide sufficient quantification of the costs of the amendments.\\\\272\\\\ in response to those comments, as additional context for our consideration of the possible effects of the final amendments, we conducted supplemental analysis of the expected frequency, type, and magnitude of potential adverse effects. we consider effects resulting from potential misreporting about the effectiveness of icfr as well as those driven by potential changes in the actual effectiveness of icfr. where possible, we estimate dollar costs as well as dollar transfers across shareholders, which represent costs to some shareholders and benefits to other shareholders. we note that these cost estimates do not fully adjust for the mitigating factors that we find to be associated with low-revenue issuers and may therefore be inflated. also, we caution against attempts to over-interpret the relation between our quantitative estimates of monetized benefits and monetized costs because we are not able to place dollar values on all of the potential costs and benefits of the amendments. \\\\272\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cfa inst., cii, prof. barth et al., and prof. ge et al. several commenters argued that the expected cost savings are too small to be economically meaningful,\\\\273\\\\ and that the amendments are unlikely to have capital formation benefits.\\\\274\\\\ we acknowledge that, while the amendments could be a positive factor in the decision of additional companies to enter public markets, it may not be the decisive factor, and the direct impact of the amendments on the number of public companies may be limited to the extent that companies may be more focused on other factors associated with the decision to go public. however, we continue to believe that the expected savings is likely, in many cases, to represent a meaningful cost savings for the affected issuers.\\\\275\\\\ in particular, while the average annual cost savings may represent a small percentage of the average affected issuers' revenues and market capitalizations, it is still likely to be meaningful given that the net income and operating cash flows of the affected issuers are typically negative.\\\\276\\\\ these savings may thus have beneficial economic effects on net capital formation through the productive use of this preserved capital towards, for example, new investments. \\\\273\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., cii, and prof. barth et al. \\\\274\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cii, cfa, cfa inst., and prof. ge et al. \\\\275\\\\ one commenter requested that we replicate, with recent data, the analysis in a previous study that found a ``bunching'' of firms below the public float threshold for entering accelerated filer status, in order to explore whether the costs of the icfr auditor attestation requirement remain as high as previously documented. see letter from prof. honigsberg, et al. see also commissioner jackson's statement. as discussed in more detail below, we provide this analysis and find that there may be some such ``bunching,'' but we note that our conclusion that the cost savings may be meaningful to the affected issuers does not rely on this analysis or the related study. \\\\276\\\\ see note 362 below. some commenters indicated that the proposing release did not adequately consider the risk of fraud,\\\\277\\\\ or that the risks of fraudulent financial reporting may be particularly high for low-revenue issuers.\\\\278\\\\ we acknowledge the argument that incentives to engage in misconduct could be different for low-revenue issuers and, in response to these comments, we conducted supplemental analysis concerning the risk of fraud. in particular, we conducted an analysis to investigate this risk and did not find evidence based on the available data that low-revenue issuers that, like the affected issuers, are not within five years of their ipo (``seasoned'' issuers), are more highly represented in the set of seasoned issuers associated with financial misconduct or financial reporting fraud than they are in the overall population of seasoned issuers.we also estimated the extent to which expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement could affect the likelihood of the affected issuers engaging in such activities and include a quantification of the associated costs of this risk in our overall assessment of the potential costs of the amendments. overall, this supplemental analysis does not because us to change our primary conclusions regarding the potential effects of the amendments. \\\\277\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa inst., cii, and prof. barth et al. \\\\278\\\\ see, e.g., letter from cfa, cfa inst., cii and prof. barth et al. the economic analysis also considers other changes associated with the amendments. for example, the affected issuers will be permitted an additional 15 days and five days, respectively, after the end of each period to file their annual and quarterly reports, relative to the deadlines that apply to accelerated filers.\\\\279\\\\ the amendments also revise the transition provisions for accelerated and large accelerated filer status, including increasing the public float thresholds to exit accelerated and large accelerated filer status from $50 million and $500 million in public float to $60 million and $560 million in public float. additionally, the amendments introduce a new check-box disclosure on the cover page of annual reports on forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f to indicate whether an icfr auditor attestation is included in the filing. \\\\279\\\\ non-accelerated filers also are not required to provide disclosure required by item 1b of form 10-k and item 4a of form 20-f about unresolved staff comments on their periodic andor current reports or disclosure required by item 101(e)(4) of regulation s-k about whether they make filings available on or through their internet websites. the discussion that follows examines the potential benefits and costs of the amendments in detail. as part of our analysis, we consider both the comments received on the proposing release and the likelihood that the effects of the icfr auditor attestation have changed over time with changes in auditing standards and other market conditions. b. baseline to assess the economic impact of the amendments, we are using as our baseline the current state of the market under the existing definition of ``accelerated filer.'' this section discusses the current regulatory requirements and market practices. it also provides statistics characterizing accelerated filers, the timing of filings, disclosures about ineffective icfr, and restatement rates under the baseline. 1. regulatory baseline our baseline includes existing statutes and commission rules that govern the responsibilities of issuers with respect to financial reporting, as well as pcaob auditing standards and market standards related to the implementation of these responsibilities. in particular, accelerated and large accelerated filers are subject to accelerated filing deadlines for their periodic reports relative to non-accelerated filers. these deadlines are summarized in table 4 below. all registrants can file form 12b-25 (``form nt'') to avail themselves of an additional 15 calendar days to file an annual report, or an additional five calendar days to file a quarterly report, and still have their report deemed to have been timely filed. table 4filing deadlines for periodic reports calendar days after period end category of filer annual quarterly non-accelerated filer 90 45 accelerated filer 75 40 large accelerated filer 60 40 the proposing release discusses in detail the issuer and auditor responsibilities with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and icfr for issuers of different filer types.\\\\280\\\\ these responsibilities derive from the fcpa requirements with respect to internal accounting controls as well as a number of different changes to financial reporting that were introduced by sox. \\\\280\\\\ see sections ii.b. and iii.b.1. of the proposing release, note 4 above. in particular, all issuers \\\\281\\\\ are required to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls \\\\282\\\\ and to have their corporate officers assess the effectiveness of the issuer's disclosure controls and procedures \\\\283\\\\ and disclose the conclusions of their assessments, typically on a quarterly basis.\\\\284\\\\ in addition, all issuers are required to have their corporate officers certify in each of their periodic reports that the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the issuer's financial condition and results of operations.\\\\285\\\\ all issuers other than rics and asset-backed securities (``abs'') issuers \\\\286\\\\ are also required to include management's assessment of the effectiveness of their icfr in their annual reports.\\\\287\\\\ further, all issuers are required to have the financial statements in their annual reports examined and reported on by an independent auditor, who, even if not engaged to provide an icfr auditor attestation, is responsible for considering icfr in the performance of the financial statement audit.\\\\288\\\\ also, an auditor engaged in a financial statement only audit may test the operating effectiveness of some internal controls in order to reduce the extent of substantive testing performed in the audit. importantly, all of these responsibilities with respect to financial reporting and icfr apply equally to non-accelerated as well as accelerated and large accelerated filers. finally, all issuers listed on national exchanges are required to have an audit committee that is composed solely of independent directors and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the issuer's independent auditors.\\\\289\\\\ the amendments do not change any of these requirements, including the requirements of a financial statement audit. \\\\281\\\\ specifically, the requirements apply to all issuers that file reports pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the exchange act. \\\\282\\\\ see section 13(b)(2)(b) of the exchange act. \\\\283\\\\ see note 209 above. \\\\284\\\\ see note 210 above. \\\\285\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.13a-14(b) and 17 cfr 240.15d-14(b). \\\\286\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.13a-15 and 17 cfr 240.15d-15. a newly public issuer is also not required to provide a sox section 404(a) management report on icfr until its second annual report filed with the commission. see instructions to item 308 of regulation s-k. \\\\287\\\\ see management's report on internal control over financial reporting and certification of disclosure in exchange act periodic reports, release no. 33-8238 (june 5, 2003) [68 fr 36635 (june 18, 2003)]. these evaluations of icfr, as well as any associated icfr auditor attestations, should be based on a suitable, recognized control framework. the most widely used framework for this purpose is the one set forth in a report of the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (``coso''). \\\\288\\\\ see pcaob as 2110, note 187 above. see also the discussion below in this section about this auditing standard. \\\\289\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.10a-3. in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation requirement, we note that the audit committee is responsible for approving whether to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation, and would be alerted by the auditor engaged in a financial statement only audit if the auditor becomes aware of a significant deficiency or material weakness in icfr. beyond these requirements, accelerated filers and large accelerated filers other than egcs, rics, and abs issuers are required under sox section 404(b) and related rules to include an icfr auditor attestation in their annual reports. in addition, certain banks, even if they are non-accelerated filers, are required under federal deposit insurance corporation (``fdic'') rules to have their auditor attest to, and report on, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the bank's icfr (the ``fdic auditor attestation requirement'').\\\\290\\\\ \\\\290\\\\ part 363 of the fdic regulations requires that the auditor of an insured depository institution with consolidated total assets of $1 billion or more (as of the beginning of the fiscal year) examine, attest to, and report separately on the assertion of management concerning the effectiveness of the institution's internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. one commenter raised questions about the nature of the fdic auditor attestation requirement and how it compares to the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\291\\\\ for banks that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, the fdic regulations require icfr attestation engagements to be performed according to the same standards as the icfr auditor attestation requirement under sox section 404(b) (i.e., as 2201,\\\\292\\\\ as discussed below).\\\\293\\\\ for other banks, the fdic allows icfr attestations to be performed either according to as 2201 or according to the american institute of certified public accountants (``aicpa'') attestation standard.\\\\294\\\\ in 2015, the auditing standards board of the aicpa issued statement on auditing standards (``sas'') no. 130, revising their attestation standard with the intention of adhering as closely as possible to as 2201 while aligning with their generally

section 404(b) reports typically mirror each other, so material weaknesses identified by the fdic auditor attestation may also become publicly known via corresponding sox section 404(a) management

required to comply with sox section 404(b) voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\297\\\\ estimates of the number of issuers of each filer type are provided in table 5 below.\\\\298\\\\ \\\\297\\\\ up to about seven percent of exempt issuers voluntarily provided an icfr auditor attestation from 2005 through 2011. see 2013 gao study, note 246 above. we find similar results when examining data for non-accelerated filers and egcs in calendar years 2014 through 2018 from ives group audit analytics to identify, among issuers of these types that have a sox section 404(a) management report, how many also have an icfr auditor attestation report available in the database. see note 298 below regarding the identification of filer types. \\\\298\\\\ the estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of self-identified filer status for issuers filing annual reports on forms 10-k, 20-f, or 40-f in calendar year 2018, excluding any such filings that pertain to fiscal years prior to 2017. staff extracted filer status from filings using a computer program supplemented with hand collection and compared the results for robustness with data from xbrl filings, ives group audit analytics, and calcbench. fpis represent those filing on forms 20-f or 40-f and do not include fpis that choose to file on form 10-k. egc issuers are identified by using data from ives group audit analytics andor by using a computer program to search issuer filings, including filings other than annual reports, for a statement regarding egc status. the estimates generally exclude rics because these issuers do not file on the annual report types considered. this table also excludes 143 issuers, mostly canadian mjds issuers filing on form 40-f (which does not require disclosure of filer status or public float), for which filer type is unavailable. table 5filer status for issuers filing annual reports in 2018 non- large acceleratedaccelerated accelerated fpi 265

auditing standard number 2 (``as no. 2'') in 2007, was intended to focus auditors on the most important matters in the audit of icfr and eliminate procedures that the pcaob believed were unnecessary to an effective audit of icfr.\\\\301\\\\ among other things, the 2007 standard facilitates the scaling of the evaluation of icfr for smaller, less complex issuers by, for example, encouraging auditors to use top-down risk-based approaches and to use the work of others in the attestation process.\\\\302\\\\ it was accompanied by commission guidance similarly facilitating the scaling of sox section 404(a) management evaluations of icfr.\\\\303\\\\ \\\\299\\\\ see note 292 above. \\\\300\\\\ as no. 5 was renumbered as as 2201, note 292 above, effective december 31, 2016. see

the quality of icfr of issuers subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement decreased relative to that of other issuers.\\\\305\\\\ around 2010, pcaob inspections of auditors began to include a heightened focus on whether auditing firms had obtained sufficient evidence to support their opinions on the effectiveness of icfr.\\\\306\\\\ there is some evidence that these inspections have led to an improvement in the reliability of icfr auditor attestations,\\\\307\\\\ but also concerns that audit fees also increased around the same time.\\\\308\\\\ \\\\304\\\\ see, e.g., study of the

pcaob adopted enhanced auditing standards related to the auditor's assessment of and response to risk.\\\\309\\\\ the enhanced risk assessment standards have likely reduced, to some extent, the degree of difference between a financial statement only audit and an integrated audit (which includes an audit of icfr) because the standards clarify and augment the extent to which internal controls are to be considered even in a financial statement only audit. in particular, the risk assessment standards applying to both types of audits require auditors, in either case, to evaluate the design of certain controls, including whether the controls are implemented.\\\\310\\\\ \\\\309\\\\ see pcaob release no. 2010-004 and pcaob release no. 2010- 01, note 193 above. \\\\310\\\\ see as 2110, paragraphs .18-.40, note 187 above. based on the results of inspections in the several years after the adoption of the new risk assessment auditing standards, the pcaob expressed concern about the number and significance of deficiencies in auditing firm compliance with these standards, but also noted promising improvements in the application of these standards.\\\\311\\\\ while the risk assessment standards may reduce the degree of difference between a financial statement only audit and an integrated audit, there remain important differences in the requirements of these audits as they relate to controls. for example, in an integrated audit, but not a financial statement only audit, the auditor is required to identify likely sources of misstatements in considering the evaluation of icfr.\\\\312\\\\ also, the extent of the procedures necessary to obtain the required understanding of controls generally will be greater in an integrated audit due to the different objectives of such an audit as compared to a financial statement only audit.\\\\313\\\\ \\\\311\\\\ see pcaob release no. 2015-007, note 195 above. \\\\312\\\\ see pcaob release no. 2010-004, note 309 above, at 7 and a10-41. as discussed above, even in a financial statement only audit, if the auditor becomes aware of a significant deficiency or material weakness in icfr, it is required to inform management and the audit committee of this finding and has the responsibility to review management's disclosure for any misstatement of facts, such as a statement that icfr is effective when there is a known material weakness. see notes 190 to 191 above and the accompanying text. \\\\313\\\\ see proposed auditing standards related to the auditor's assessment of and response to risk and conforming amendments to pcaob standards, pcaob release no. 2008-006 a9-8 (october 21, 2008). the commission recently settled charges against four public companies for failing to maintain effective icfr for seven to 10 consecutive annual reporting periods.\\\\314\\\\ these enforcement cases may have a deterrent effect among issuers failing to remediate material weaknesses, which might reduce the overall rate of persistence of material weaknesses in icfr. \\\\314\\\\ see sec press release, note 196 above. we also note that there have been some recent changes in accounting and auditing that are part of our baseline and could increase the uncertainty of our analysis due to their effects on factors such as audit fees, restatements, and icfr. for example, three new reporting standards have been issued recently by fasb, on the topics of revenue recognition, leases, and credit losses, which could temporarily increase audit fees as issuers and auditors adjust to the new standards.\\\\315\\\\ recent changes in technology, such as the potential for management to use automated controls testing and process automation,\\\\316\\\\ may result in improvements in icfr regardless of the icfr auditor attestation requirement if their increased application results in more robust financial reporting processes with fewer opportunities for deficiencies andor in an increase by management in control testing and related improvements. such automation could also reduce audit fees, including the costs of an audit of icfr, but at least one report suggests that the uptake of these technologies has been slow.\\\\317\\\\ finally, auditors have had many years of experience with integrated audits, as well as risk assessment standards that require the consideration of icfr even in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation. this experience may affect their execution of financial statement only audits of issuers for whom the icfr auditor attestation requirement is eliminated. for example, given their experience, auditors may be more likely to detect control deficiencies or to increase their auditing efficiency by reducing substantive testing in favor of testing some related controls even when an icfr auditor attestation is not required.\\\\318\\\\ \\\\315\\\\ information on these and other fasb accounting standards updates is available at . \\\\316\\\\ see, e.g., robotic process automation, note 197 above. \\\\317\\\\ see, e.g., protiviti survey results, benchmarking sox costs, hours and controls (2018) (``protiviti 2018 report''). \\\\318\\\\ 2011 sec staff study, note 198 above, (stating that ``. . . once effective controls are in place at the issuer, the auditor is more likely to continue to test them even if [it is] not issuing an auditor attestation during a particular year in order to rely on them for purposes of reducing substantive testing in the audit of the financial statements, particularly for issuers that are larger and more complex''). 2. characteristics of accelerated filer population per table 5, there were approximately 1,400 accelerated filers in total in 2018. figure 2 \\\\319\\\\ presents the distribution of public float across these issuers.\\\\320\\\\ \\\\319\\\\ the estimates in the figure are based on staff analysis of data from xbrl filings. see note 298 above for details on the identification of the population of accelerated filers. \\\\320\\\\ because of the accelerated filer transition provisions, some accelerated filers have float below $75 million. the public float of these issuers would previously have exceeded $75 million, causing them to enter accelerated filer status, but has not dropped below the $50 million public float level required to exit accelerated filer status. billing code 8011-01-p [graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.001 billing code 8011-01-c the distribution of public float among accelerated filers is skewed towards lower levels of float, but higher levels of float are also significantly represented. figure 3 \\\\321\\\\ presents the distribution of revenues across those accelerated filers that have less than $1 billion in revenues. while the full population of accelerated filers has revenues of up to over $20 billion, about 90 percent of accelerated filers have less than $1 billion in revenues. we restrict the figure to this subset in order to more clearly display the distribution in this range. \\\\321\\\\ the estimates of revenues are based on staff analysis of data from xbrl filings, compustat, and calcbench. the revenue data used is from the last fiscal year prior to the annual report in calendar year 2018, because the src revenue test is based on the prior year's revenues. see note 298 above for details on the identification of the population of accelerated filers. [graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.002 the distribution of revenues for accelerated filers is heavily skewed towards lower levels of revenue, with roughly three-quarters of accelerated filers having revenues of less than $500 million and more than a third having revenues of less than $100 million. other than a clustering of issuers with zero or near zero revenues, there are no obvious breaks in the distribution. while a large range of industries are represented among accelerated filers, a small number of industries account for the majority of these issuers. the ``banking'' industry accounts for about 14.1 percent of accelerated filers, followed by ``pharmaceutical products'' (13.9 percent) ``financial trading'' (8.0 percent), ``business services'' (5.7 percent), ``petroleum and natural gas'' (4.8 percent), ``computer software'' (4.4 percent), ``retail'' (4.4 percent), ``transportation'' (4.2 percent), and ``electronic equipment'' (4.1 percent).\\\\322\\\\ \\\\322\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of data including sic codes from xbrl filings and ives group audit analytics, using the fama-french 49-industry classification system. see . see note 298 above for details on identification of population of accelerated filers. 3. timing of filings as discussed above, non-accelerated, accelerated, and large accelerated filers face different filing deadlines for their periodic reports. in table 6, we present the timing in recent years of annual report filings by these different groups of issuers relative to their corresponding deadlines.\\\\323\\\\ \\\\323\\\\ the estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of edgar filings. these statistics include all annual reports on forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f filed in calendar years 2014 through 2018 other than amendments. if multiple annual reports (excluding amendments) are filed in the same calendar year, the analysis considers only the latest such filing. given the effect of weekends and holidays, filings are considered to be on time if within two calendar days after the original deadline. the ``5 days early'' and ``over 15 days after'' categories are similarly adjusted to account for the possible effect of weekends and holidays. see note 298 above for details on the identification of filer type. table 6filing timing for annual reports in years 2014 through 2018, by filer status non-accelerated accelerated large accelerated annual report filing deadline 90 days 75 days 60 days. average days to file 101 days 70 days 56 days. percentage filed: by deadline 72% 91% 94%. over 5 days early 44% 63% 61%. after deadline 28% 9% 6%. over 15 days after deadline.. 13% 5% 4%. table 6 documents that accelerated and large accelerated filers file their annual reports, on average, four or five days before the applicable deadline. nine percent and six percent, respectively, of accelerated and large accelerated filers submit their annual reports after the initial deadline, with roughly half of these filers surpassing the 15-day grace period that is obtained by filing form nt. non-accelerated filers are less likely to meet their initial deadline or extended deadline, with the average non-accelerated filer submitting its annual report 11 days after the initial deadline and 13 percent of non-accelerated filers filing after the 15-day grace period obtained by filing form nt. 4. internal controls and restatements we next consider the current rates of ineffective icfr and restatements \\\\324\\\\ among issuers that are accelerated filers under the baseline relative to other filer types. the data for all years of the analysis has been updated relative to the analysis in the proposing release.\\\\325\\\\ throughout our analysis, we use the term restatement to refer to a restatement that is associated with some type of misstatement. as discussed above, non-accelerated filers and egcs are statutorily exempted from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. table 7 presents the percentage of issuers reporting ineffective icfr in recent years by filer type.\\\\326\\\\ \\\\324\\\\ unless otherwise specified, statistics and analysis regarding restatements are not restricted to those restatements requiring form 8-k item 4.02 disclosure. \\\\325\\\\ previous years of data may be revised due to, for example, newly disclosed restatements that reflect misstatements in these earlier years, restated internal control reports that relate to previous fiscal years, previously incomplete data that was later populated, or other updates or database changes. \\\\326\\\\ the estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of ives group audit analytics data. icfr effectiveness is based on the last amended management or auditor attestation report for the fiscal year. percentages are computed out of all issuers of a given filer type with the specified type of report available in the ives group audit analytics database. see note 298 above for details on the identification of filer type. table 7percentage of issuers reporting ineffective icfr non- large ineffective icfr year reported in accelerated accelerated accelerated (%) (%) (%) management report:

weakness in icfr in a given year.\\\\327\\\\ this represents a moderately higher rate than that among large accelerated filers, approximately four percent, on average, of which reported ineffective icfr,\\\\328\\\\ and a substantially lower rate than that among non-accelerated filers, more than a third of which reported ineffective icfr each year.\\\\329\\\\ for issuers subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, the rates of ineffective icfr reported by management and by auditors are similar.\\\\330\\\\ this may not be surprising, as management will be made aware of any material weaknesses discovered by the auditor and vice versa. \\\\327\\\\ per the second column of the first panel of table 7, the rate of ineffective icfr among accelerated filers has ranged from 7.8 to 9.5 percent for the years 2014 through 2018, for an average per year of 8.9 percent. \\\\328\\\\ per the third column of the first panel of table 7, the rate of ineffective icfr among large accelerated filers has ranged from 3.2 to 5.0 percent for the years 2014 through 2018, for an average per year of 4.1 percent. \\\\329\\\\ per the first column of the first panel of table 7, the rate of ineffective icfr among non-accelerated filers has ranged from 38.3 to 41.2 percent for the years 2014 through 2018, for an average per year of 40.0 percent. \\\\330\\\\ per the second column of table 7, the average rate of ineffective icfr for accelerated filers across years 2014 through 2018 was 8.9 percent as reported in management reports and 8.8 percent as reported in auditor reports. similarly, per the third column of table 7, the average rate of ineffective icfr for large accelerated filers across years 2014 through 2018 was 4.1 percent as reported in management reports and 4.1 percent as reported in auditor reports. we next consider the persistence of material weaknesses across these issuer categories. table 8 \\\\331\\\\ presents the percentage of issuers that reported two, three, or four consecutive years of ineffective icfr culminating in 2018, by filer type.\\\\332\\\\ \\\\331\\\\ the estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of ives group audit analytics data. icfr effectiveness is based on the last amended management report for the fiscal year. percentages in the first panel are computed out of all issuers of a given filer type in 2018 with sox section 404(a) management reports available in ives group audit analytics database, while percentages in the second panel are computed out of issuers of a given filer type reporting ineffective icfr in their sox section 404(a) management report for 2018. see fourth row of table 7 and note 298 above for details on the identification of filer type. \\\\332\\\\ one commenter noted that the proposing release, note 4 above, indicated that over 68 percent of non-accelerated filers have reported two consecutive years of ineffective icfr and over 38 percent have reported four consecutive years of ineffective icfr in their annual reports. see letter from better markets. to clarify, we note that these statistics, like those reported in the second panel of table 8 below, reflect percentages out of the issuers in each category that maintained ineffective icfr in the last year of the analysis, not percentages of all issuers in each category. table 8percentage of issuers

the overall rate of persistently ineffective icfr among issuers of different types, while the second panel is intended to demonstrate the degree of persistence of ineffective icfr among the subset of issuers of each type that report ineffective icfr in 2018. compared to non-accelerated filers, we find that a smaller percentage of accelerated and large accelerated filers report material weaknesses that persist for multiple years, with about one percent of accelerated filers and about 0.3 percent of large accelerated filers reporting ineffective icfr for four consecutive years (per the third row of the table), representing about 11 percent of the accelerated filers and about seven percent of the large accelerated filers that reported ineffective icfr in 2018 (per the last row of the table). a larger percentage of non-accelerated filers persistently report material weaknesses, with about 16 percent of these issuers (per the third row of the table), or about 40 percent of those reporting ineffective icfr in 2018 (per the last row of the table), having reported material weaknesses for four consecutive years. as discussed above, it is possible that recent commission enforcement actions might lead to a reduction in the persistence of material weaknesses in icfr to the extent that they change issuers' awareness of the risks of longstanding icfr failures. table 9 presents the rate of restatements among each of these filer types, excluding egcs, and for egcs separately. for each year, we consider the percentage of issuers that eventually restated the financial statements for that year. the reporting lag before restatements are filed results in a lower observed rate in the later years of our sample, particularly for 2017 (and even more so for 2018, which we do not report for this reason), as issuers may yet restate their results from recent years.\\\\333\\\\ table 9percentage of issuers issuing restatements by year of restated data non- accelerated accelerated large

issuers that make at least one restatement, of any type, while the second panel presents those that make at least one restatement requiring form 8-k item 4.02 disclosure. the latter type of restatement (``item 4.02 restatements'') reflects material misstatements, while other restatements deal with misstatements that are considered immaterial. we find that egcs, which are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement and generally are also younger issuers than those in the other groups, restate their financial statements at higher rates than other issuers, whether we consider all restatements or only item 4.02 restatements. for non-accelerated filers, which also are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, we find that the percentage of issuers reporting item 4.02 restatements is similar to, and the rate of all restatements slightly lower than, that for accelerated filers who are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. we note that there is a greater proportion of low-revenue issuers in the non- accelerated filer category than in other categories, and that, in the proposing release, we found such issuers to have lower rates of restatement than other issuers.\\\\334\\\\ when, in the proposing release, we separately considered issuers with revenues below $100 million, we found that the accelerated filers in this category are less likely to restate their financial statements than non-accelerated filers in the same revenue category.\\\\335\\\\ \\\\333\\\\ the estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of ives group audit analytics data. percentages are computed out of all issuers of a given filer type with a sox section 404(a) management report available in the ives group audit analytics database. accelerated and non-accelerated categories exclude egcs that are in these filer categories. see note 298 above for details on the identification of filer type. \\\\334\\\\ see table 14 in the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\335\\\\ id. c. discussion of economic effects the costs and benefits of the amendments, including impacts on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, are discussed below. we first address the population and characteristics of issuers that will newly qualify as non-accelerated filers under the amendments, and then introduce certain categories of issuers that are used for comparison purposes. we next discuss the anticipated costs and benefits associated with the proposed change in applicability of the icfr auditor attestation requirement. following this discussion, we consider the costs and benefits associated with the proposed changes with respect to filing deadlines, exit thresholds, and other required disclosures. finally, we consider the relative benefits and costs of the principal reasonable alternatives to the amendments. 1. affected issuers we estimate that the amendments will result in 527 additional issuers being classified as non-accelerated filers, and therefore no longer subject to the filing deadlines and icfr auditor attestation requirement applicable to accelerated filers.\\\\336\\\\ of these, an estimated 154 issuers are egcs and are thereby already exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\337\\\\ among the total 527 affected issuers, an estimated 492 issuers are accelerated filers (or large accelerated filers that have public float of less than $560 million) that will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers because they have annual revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to be srcs.\\\\338\\\\ an additional 28 issuers are bdcs that will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers because they are currently accelerated filers (and therefore have public float of less than $700 million) and have annual investment income of less than $100 million.\\\\339\\\\ the remaining seven affected issuers are accelerated filers that will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers despite having revenues of at least $100 million because they have a public float of at least $50 million but less than $60 million.\\\\340\\\\ our estimate of the number of affected issuers excludes issuers for which we were unable to determine filer classification or revenues, which could represent up to approximately an additional 30 affected issuers. \\\\336\\\\ the number of affected issuers is based on staff estimates of: (i) the number of accelerated filers in 2018 that have prior fiscal year revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to be srcs (i.e., excluding abs issuers, rics, bdcs, subsidiaries of non-srcs, and fpis filing on foreign forms or using ifrs) or are bdcs with prior year investment income of less than $100 million; (ii) the number of large accelerated filers in 2018 that have a public float of less than $560 million and prior fiscal year revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to be srcs; and (iii) the number of accelerated filers in 2018 that have a public float of at least $50 million but less than $60 million. the estimate of the number of affected issuers does not include large accelerated filers that have a public float of at least $560 million but less than $700 million even though such issuers could become non-accelerated filers under the amendments if they became eligible to be srcs under the src revenue test in the first year the src amendments became effective due to the limited horizon of this accommodation. see note 252 above (describing the accommodation provided in the src adopting release). revenue data is sourced from xbrl filings, compustat, and calcbench. public float data is from xbrl. see note 298 above for details on the identification of the population of accelerated and large accelerated filers and other filer types. \\\\337\\\\ id. \\\\338\\\\ id. \\\\339\\\\ id. \\\\340\\\\ id. our estimate of the number of affected issuers does not include any fpis. we estimate that there are no fpis that file on domestic forms and present their financial statements pursuant to you.s. gaap, and that also meet the required thresholds and other qualifications to be an affected issuer under the amendments. however, there are an estimated 31 fpis that file on foreign forms, but otherwise meet the required thresholds and other qualifications. there are also fpis filing on foreign forms for which we were unable to determine filer classification or revenues, which could represent up to approximately an additional 90 fpis that file on foreign forms but that may meet the required thresholds and other qualifications.\\\\341\\\\ while we do not include these issuers in our counts of the number of affected issuers,\\\\342\\\\ some of these 30 to 120 additional issuers might choose to file on domestic forms using you.s. gaap in order to benefit from the amendments if these benefits, together with other benefits of such a choice (such as the ability to rely on the scaled disclosure accommodations available to srcs) outweigh the costs of changing their disclosure regime. however, many factors are involved in the choice of a reporting regime, and it is difficult to predict how many of these issuers are likely to change their reporting practices due to the amendments. \\\\341\\\\ the majority of these potential additional issuers are canadian mjds filers that are not required to disclose filer type or public float. see note 298 above. \\\\342\\\\ in the proposing release, note 4 above, we included fpis that file on foreign forms, but otherwise meet the required thresholds and other qualifications, in the number of affected issuers. while these issuers could become subject to the amendments by changing their reporting regime, it is difficult to predict how many would do so and therefore, to be conservative, we do not include them in the number of affected issuers in this release. as noted above, the total number of affected issuers includes an estimated 154 egcs (including 152 egcs with annual revenues or, in the case of bdcs, investment income of less than $100 million and two egcs that will be affected because they have a public float of at least $50 million but less than $60 million).\\\\343\\\\ it also includes an estimated 78 banks with $1 billion or more in total assets that are not egcs.\\\\344\\\\ the estimated 154 egcs are not required to comply with the icfr auditor attestation requirement under sox section 404(b). we estimate that the remaining 373 affected issuers will, including 21 bdcs, be newly exempt from this requirement.\\\\345\\\\ two commenters provided estimates of 382 affected issuers and 385 affected issuers, respectively, as the number of issuers that would be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement under the proposal.\\\\346\\\\ while these estimates are largely consistent with our estimate, we note that the commenters' estimates apply some simplifications and use different underlying data sources than our estimate.\\\\347\\\\ \\\\343\\\\ see note 336 above. \\\\344\\\\ banks are identified as issuers with sic codes of 6020 (commercial banks), 6021 (national commercial banks), 6022 (state commercial banks), 6029 (nec commercial banks), 6035 (savings institutions, federally-chartered) or 6036 (savings institutions, not federally-chartered). \\\\345\\\\ of these 373 issuers, 368 had less than $100 million in revenues (or, in the case of bdcs, investment income) in their last fiscal year, while the remaining five would be affected despite having greater revenues because of the revised transition provisions (i.e., because their public float is at least $50 million but less than $60 million). \\\\346\\\\ see letters from cfa inst. and prof. barth et al. see also letter from nasdaq, estimating that at least 399 nasdaq-listed companies may be affected by the amendments. \\\\347\\\\ for example, neither commenter excludes from its estimate issuers that are not eligible to be srcs or adjusts for the effect of the revised transition thresholds as described in note 336 above and note 151 of the proposing release, note 4 above. the letter from cfa inst. appears to rely on a footnote in the proposing release that, while citing to the correct definitions of egc in our rules, incorrectly stated that an egc is an issuer that has total annual gross revenues of ``less than $1.07 million'' during its most recently completed fiscal year (rather than the correct threshold of ``less than $1.07 billion'') and did not identify the other requirements to be an egc (such as not having reached the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer under an effective securities act registration statement as an egc). see footnote 47 of the proposing release, note 4 above. the estimate in the letter from cfa inst. also excluded all 10-k filers with the sic code 6200 (``security & commodity brokers, dealers, exchanges & services''), which we do not believe is appropriate. while the letter correctly indicates that the icfr auditor attestation requirement does not apply to audits of brokers and dealers performed pursuant to sec rule 17a-5, these audits apply to the reports required by rule 17a-5, which are distinct from a form 10-k filing. issuers filing form 10-ks that have a subsidiary that is a broker or dealer are not treated differently from other issuers with respect to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. of the 373 issuers that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement, we estimate that the 78 banks identified above will be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement,\\\\348\\\\ while the remaining 295 issuers will not be subject to any such auditor attestation requirement.\\\\349\\\\ for the banks that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement but will remain subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement, the benefits and costs of expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement are both expected to be limited. as discussed in section iv.b.1. above, the fdic auditor attestation requirement is substantively similar to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, and is thus expected to require similar expenditures and have similar financial reporting benefits as the icfr auditor attestation. \\\\348\\\\ if these banks are no longer subject to the sox section 404(b) auditor attestation requirement, their auditors may follow the aicpa's auditing standards in lieu of the pcaob's auditing standards for the fdic auditor attestation. see section 18a of appendix a to fdic rule 363 and the aicpa's au-c section 940. see also section iii.b.1. above. \\\\349\\\\ of these 274 issuers, 269 are accelerated filers (or large accelerated filers that have public float of less than $560 million) that will be newly classified as non-accelerated filers because they have annual revenues of less than $100 million and are eligible to be srcs, while the remaining five will be newly classified as non- accelerated filers despite having revenues of at least $100 million because they have a public float of at least $50 million but less than $60 million. we estimate that approximately 90 percent of the affected issuers (whether including or excluding egcs) have securities that are listed on national exchanges.\\\\350\\\\ the representation in public markets of issuers similar to the affected issuers has decreased relative to the years before sox. in particular, over the past two decades, the number of issuers listed on major exchanges has decreased by about 40 percent,\\\\351\\\\ but the decline has been concentrated among smaller size issuers. specifically, the number of listed issuers with market capitalization below $700 million has decreased by about 65 percent,\\\\352\\\\ and the number of listed issuers with less than $100 million in revenue has decreased by about 60 percent.\\\\353\\\\ one commenter noted that these statistics do not establish that the costs of the icfr auditor attestation materially contributed to the decline in listed issuers, and that there are a number of other factors that are likely implicated in the decline of listings.\\\\354\\\\ we cite these statistics to characterize the affected issuers, not to attribute the decline in listings to any particular because. as noted below, the amendments could be a positive factor in the decision of additional companies to enter public markets, but it may not be the decisive factor, and the direct impact of the amendments on the number of public companies may be limited to the extent that companies may be more focused on other factors associated with the decision to go public.\\\\355\\\\ \\\\350\\\\ staff extracted information regarding whether issuers reported having securities registered under section 12(b) of the

public float across the full sample of affected issuers.\\\\357\\\\ \\\\356\\\\ the estimates in this figure are based on staff analysis of data from xbrl filings. we corrected the public float data based on hand-collection from form 10-k filings for five affected issuers whose public float reported in xbrl format was 1,000 times the public float reported on the cover page of the corresponding form 10-k filing, resulting in values of over $50 billion in public float reported in xbrl. see note 336 above for details on the identification of the population of affected issuers. \\\\357\\\\ because of the accelerated filer transition provisions, some of the affected issuers have public float of at least $50 million but below $75 million. see note 320 above. billing code 8011-01-p [graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.003 relative to the distribution for all accelerated filers presented in figure 2, the sample of affected issuers is more strongly skewed toward lower levels of public float, with higher levels of public float only thinly represented. however, some of the affected issuers do have public float approaching the top of the range for accelerated filers. figure 5 presents the distribution of revenues across the 520 accelerated filers (or large accelerated filers with public float of less than $560 million) that will be newly classified as non- accelerated filers because they have revenues (or, in the case of bdcs, investment income) of less than $100 million.\\\\358\\\\ \\\\358\\\\ the estimates in this figure are based on staff analysis of data from xbrl filings, compustat, and calcbench. the revenue data used is from the last fiscal year prior to the annual report in calendar year 2018, because the src revenue test is based on the prior year's revenues. see note 336 above for details on the identification of the population of affected issuers. [graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.004 billing code 8011-01-c other than a concentration of issuers with zero or near zero revenues,\\\\359\\\\ these affected issuers are fairly evenly distributed over different levels of revenue up to $100 million in revenues. the additional seven affected issuers with revenues of at least $100 million but a public float of less than $60 million have revenues ranging from $119 million to $2.1 billion, with a mean of about $770 million in revenues. \\\\359\\\\ approximately 13 percent of the estimated 520 affected issuers with revenues of less than $100 million and approximately 11 percent of the estimated 290 affected issuers with revenues of less than $100 million that would be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements (i.e., those that are not egcs and are not banks subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement) have zero revenues. the affected issuers are estimated to have median total assets of about $185 million, a median number of employees of about 115, and a median age of about 12 years.\\\\360\\\\ for those issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements (i.e., those that are not egcs and are not banks subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement), the median total assets and median number of employees are somewhat lower at about $125 million and 85 employees, and the median issuer age is slightly higher at about 19 years.\\\\361\\\\ the majority of the affected issuers have negative net income and negative net cash flows from operations.\\\\362\\\\

requirement), the median net income is approximately negative $6 million and the median net cash flows from operations is approximately negative $6 million. the affected issuers are heavily concentrated, based on the number of issuers, in the ``pharmaceutical products'' (29.1 percent), ``banking'' (22.4 percent),\\\\363\\\\ ``financial trading'' (16.0 percent), ``medical equipment'' (4.4 percent), and ``electronic equipment'' (3.8 percent) industries.\\\\364\\\\ if the distribution of eligible issuers does not change over time, the amendments could lead to a noticeable decrease in the presence of ``pharmaceutical products'' and ``banking'' issuers in the pool of accelerated filers. \\\\363\\\\ for the 295 affected issuers that would be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements (i.e., those that are not egcs and are not banks subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement), the proportion of ``banking'' issuers drops to 7.8 percent. by contrast, the proportion in other industries does not change by more than a few percentage points. \\\\364\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of data including sic codes from xbrl filings and ives group audit analytics, using the fama-french 49-industry classification system. bdcs are manually-classified as members of the ``financial trading'' industry under this system as sic codes were unavailable from our sources for the vast majority of these issuers. see . see note 336 above for details on the identification of the population of affected issuers. one commenter noted they sought to understand the industry concentration of the affected issuers based on measures such as their public float, revenues, and total assets.\\\\365\\\\ based on their public float relative to the aggregate public float of the affected issuers, the affected issuers are heavily concentrated in the ``pharmaceutical products'' (33.5 percent), ``banking'' (20.0 percent), ``financial trading'' (17.0 percent), and ``medical equipment'' (5.0 percent) industries.\\\\366\\\\ because revenues and total assets may be less comparable across industries of different types, we do not present the fraction of the aggregate revenue and assets of the affected issuers represented by each industry. as an alternative that we believe may be more informative, we present, in table 10, the estimated proportion of all of the accelerated filers in each industry that will be affected by the amendments (i.e., become non-accelerated), calculated based on several different measures of the size of the affected issuer pool in a given industry.\\\\367\\\\ we focus this table on non-egcs, and present affected issuers in the ``banking'' industry both including and excluding those that will remain subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement, in order to highlight the disproportionate effects by industry in terms of the issuers that will newly be exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement.

62 in ``financial trading,'' 16 in ``medical equipment,'' and 16 in ``electronic equipment.'' the table excludes two affected issuers for which an industry classification was unavailable. amongst the industries in which the affected issuers are most greatly concentrated, issuers in the ``pharmaceutical products'' industry are the most disproportionately affected based on the number, total assets, revenues, and public float of the affected issuers (other than egcs) relative to the representation of this industry among accelerated filers (other than egcs). while a substantial fraction of accelerated filers other than egcs in the ``banking'' industry are also affected issuers, consistent with one commenter's finding that ``banking'' is the industry most affected by the amendments,\\\\368\\\\ the proportion of this industry that is affected is significantly reduced once we exclude banks that would be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement and are therefore expected to experience limited benefits and costs as a result of the amendments. \\\\368\\\\ see letter from cfa inst. 2. potential benefits of expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement for affected issuers the icfr auditor attestation requirement has been associated with increased audit fees and other compliance costs. exempting the affected issuers from this requirement therefore is likely to have the benefit of reducing compliance costs for these issuers. given the disproportionate burden that the fixed component of compliance costs imposes on smaller issuers, as well as the likelihood that many of the affected issuers face financing constraints, these costs savings may enhance capital formation and competition. the discussion below explores the anticipated cost savings and their potential implications in detail. this discussion is focused on affected issuers that are not expected to be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement. we begin by summarizing evidence on the indirect costs and net costs of the icfr auditor attestation requirement. we then estimate the anticipated effects on audit fees and on other compliance costs of expanding the exemption from this requirement for the affected issuers, using reported audit fees, survey data, and existing studies. finally, we discuss the implications of the cost savings and other potential benefits. a. evidence on possible indirect costs of the icfr auditor attestation requirement the icfr auditor attestation requirement may impose costs on issuers and investors beyond the direct costs of compliance. for example, an increased focus on icfr as a result of the icfr auditor attestation requirement could have negative effects on issuer performance, if it creates a distraction from operational matters or reduces investment or risk-taking.\\\\369\\\\ one issuer noted in its comments that its managers' attention was diverted away from its operating performance in its first year complying with the icfr auditor attestation requirement, and that, without this requirement, its managers' time could have been more productively spent focusing on opportunities to grow the company.\\\\370\\\\ broader evidence of the indirect costs of the icfr auditor attestation requirement is inconclusive. studies have documented a decrease in investment and risk-taking by you.s. companies compared to companies in other countries around the passage of sox.\\\\371\\\\ however, others have demonstrated that these findings are merely the continuation of a trend that began many years before the passage of sox \\\\372\\\\ and that they do not appear to be driven by the applicability of the icfr auditor attestation or sox section 404(a) management icfr reporting requirements.\\\\373\\\\ another study associates the sox section 404 requirements with a decrease in patents and patent citations, but the findings are limited to the early years of implementation of these requirements and the study is not able to distinguish to what extent the effects are attributable to the sox section 404(a) management icfr reporting requirements versus the sox section 404(b) icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\374\\\\ we are unable to quantify the potential indirect cost savings resulting from the amendments due to the lack of reliable evidence and data that would allow us to quantitatively identify such effects. \\\\369\\\\ see john coates & suraj srinivasan, sox after ten years: a multidisciplinary review, 28(3) account. horizons 627 at 643-645 (2014)

[graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.005 figure 6 presents the distribution of public float across issuers other than banks, abs issuers, and rics. we exclude abs issuers and rics because they are unlikely to be sensitive to the public float threshold as they would not be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement (or able to avail themselves of the disclosure accommodations for srcs) regardless of their public float. we exclude banks because they may be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement, which, as discussed above, is comparable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, regardless of their public float. while egcs would not be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement regardless of their public float, we nevertheless include them in figure 6 because it is a temporary exemption and such issuers may already consider the implications of their public float in advance of graduating from this status. however, we obtain similar results when we include or exclude any of these categories of issuers. the pattern in figure 6 demonstrates that there may be some ``bunching'' of public floats below the $75 million threshold in 2018. the pattern is similar to that presented in two recent studies that find a discontinuity in public float at the $75 million threshold when considering data across the 12 or 13 year period ending in 2015.\\\\384\\\\ our findings for 2018 also are consistent with a year-by-year analysis in one of these studies that suggests that this behavior does not appear to change significantly over the time period

less consistent with another analysis of public float, which failed to find evidence of ``bunching'' in 2017.\\\\386\\\\ this analysis was cited in a submission to the comment file.\\\\387\\\\ when we examine the data underlying this analysis,\\\\388\\\\ we find that, although we obtain public float data from different sources,\\\\389\\\\ our public float values are over 90 percent correlated with those used in tthis analysis. we note, however, that the analysis applies sample selection filters that exclude, among other issuers, issuers that would become newly subject to an icfr auditor attestation requirement (and, during this time period, lose the disclosure accommodations for srcs) upon crossing the $75 million public float threshold. the exclusions result in a sample size that is approximately half as large as that in our analysis.\\\\390\\\\ for example, we understand that the other analysis excludes all financial institutions and issuers with a market capitalization of greater than $150 million.\\\\391\\\\ this difference, we find, accounts for the bulk of the difference in our figures. thus, our analysis reflects a significantly larger and more representative sample of issuers and may therefore be more reliable. \\\\386\\\\ see commissioner jackson's statement. while we provide results for 2018 in figure 6 in order to present the most recent and reliable available data, we obtain very similar results when running the same analysis for 2017. \\\\387\\\\ see letter from prof. barth et al., citing an analysis in commissioner jackson's statement that finds no evidence of bunching in 2017. \\\\388\\\\ see ``public float data (2017)'' available at . \\\\389\\\\ the data underlying the analysis cited by a commenter is generated by using a computer program to extract text from annual reports, applying computer algorithms and filters to isolate public float numbers, and then manually checking the results. see commissioner jackson's statement. the data underlying our analysis is based on xbrl filings. \\\\390\\\\ the figure in the other analysis reflects 388 issuers, compared to 731, or almost twice as many issuers, in our analysis. \\\\391\\\\ financial institutions are issuers with sic codes between 6000 and 6999 and include issuers that are not banks. other filters applied in that analysis include requiring that market capitalization data be available and that the reported public float be at least 10%, but no more than three times, the market capitalization. as discussed above, if issuers seek to avoid crossing the $75 million public float threshold, such behavior could reflect a high net cost of the icfr auditor attestation requirement but could also reflect a self-serving desire to avoid scrutiny. any such behavior could also be influenced by other requirements associated with this public float threshold during this time period, such as the loss of scaled disclosure accommodations available to srcs.\\\\392\\\\ thus, though we have considered the studies, evidence, and comments received regarding this avoidance behavior, the conclusions in this economic analysis do not rely on these findings. \\\\392\\\\ the analysis presented in figure 6 is based on annual reports filed in calendar year 2018, which generally pertain to 2017 fiscal years. the amendments to the src definition were effective on september 10, 2018. see src adopting release, note 12 above. ii. studies based on comparative analysis or market reactions we have also considered studies that have used other methodologies to attempt to quantify the net costs or benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement. one study attempts to quantify and compare certain costs and benefits of exempting non-accelerated filers from the icfr auditor attestation requirement, focusing on those costs and benefits that the study deems to be measurable, and finds that the cost savings associated with exempting these issuers (an estimated $388 million in aggregate audit fee savings) have been less than the lost benefits (e.g., an aggregate $719 million in lower earnings) in aggregate present value terms.\\\\393\\\\ studies have also used stock market reactions to changes in the applicability of the icfr auditor attestation requirement to estimate its net costs or benefits, because the stock market valuation should incorporate both expected costs and expected benefits from a shareholder's perspective. we focus on studies that consider events that allow the effects of the icfr auditor attestation requirement to be isolated from those of the other requirements that were imposed by sox, as many early studies did not isolate the effects of the icfr auditor attestation requirement from other changes required by the same legislation, such as the audit committee requirements of sox section 301 \\\\394\\\\ and the certifications required pursuant to sox section 302. regardless, the results of the studies we focus on have been mixed, perhaps due in part to changes over time in how the icfr auditor attestation requirement has been implemented. for example, a study analyzing the response to announcements of initial delays in the application of the requirements to some issuers in order to identify the stock market reaction associated with the icfr auditor attestation requirement found that this requirement was associated with a net reduction in stock market valuation for foreign issuers.\\\\395\\\\ on the other hand, a study of the response to the later permanent exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement for some issuers found that this requirement was associated with a net increase in stock market valuation for smaller issuers.\\\\396\\\\ the latter finding is consistent with studies that conclude that the requirement is value-enhancing based on a negative stock market reaction to issuers excluding acquired operations from management's assessment of icfr and the icfr auditor attestation, though these studies do not determine the extent to which this effect is attributable to the icfr auditor attestation.\\\\397\\\\ similarly, a study of smaller issuers that switched regimes over time found that being subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement was associated with an increase in stock market valuation for these issuers.\\\\398\\\\ \\\\393\\\\ we note that the estimates in this study rely on a number of critical assumptions and estimations. see weili ge, allison koester, & sarah mcvay, benefits and costs of sarbanes-oxley section 404(b) exemption: evidence from small firms' internal control disclosures, 63 j. of account. and econ. 358 (2017) (``ge et al. 2017 study'') (estimating the effect on audit fees by comparing the audit fees of non-accelerated filers to those of accelerated filers with market capitalization of $300 million or less; and estimating the effect on earnings by estimating the percentage of non-accelerated filers that may newly disclose ineffective icfr upon entering an icfr auditor attestation requirement, based on changes in the rate of disclosure of ineffective icfr by issuers that transition into accelerated filer status, and applying to this estimate a further estimate of the difference in return on assets that could be associated with such disclosure and any related remediation, based on the results of a multivariate regression relating issuers' change in return on assets to a number of factors, including whether or not they disclosed and remediated ineffective icfr). this study also estimates a delay over three years in the timing of a market value decline (that would otherwise have occurred at the beginning of this three year period) of $935 million associated with the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. \\\\394\\\\ 15 you.s.c. 78j-1. \\\\395\\\\ see iliev 2010 study, note 376 above. this study also finds a net reduction in value for small domestic issuers from the sox section 404 requirements, but is not able, for these issuers, to isolate the effect attributable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement versus the sox section 404(a) management icfr reporting requirement.

financial reporting, working paper (2014) (``jia et al. 2014 study''), available at . iii. other evidence on net costs the rate of exempt issuers voluntarily obtaining an icfr auditor attestation has generally been low.\\\\399\\\\ consistent with this finding, a commenter indicated that small biotechnology companies are rarely asked by investors to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\400\\\\ this may indicate that exempt issuers, when considering their own net cost or benefit of compliance, including how investors would react to their decisions, have typically deemed it to be more beneficial to expend these resources on other uses. however, as discussed in section iv.c.3.d. below, it is probably not the case that issuers would voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation in every case in which, from the market or an investor's perspective, the total benefits of doing so would exceed the total costs. \\\\399\\\\ see note 297 above. \\\\400\\\\ see letter from bio. see also letter from ardelyx presentation, referencing similar statements in the bio study, note 69 above, (which states that ``the low rate of voluntary compliance by [biotechnology egcs] suggests that investors do not demand or value costly section 404(b) auditor attestations''). when considering the net tradeoff between costs and benefits for accelerated filers with low revenues in particular, we also re-examined data from the sec-sponsored survey of financial executives conducted during december 2008 and january 2009 (``2008-09 survey'').\\\\401\\\\ while the results of this survey might not be directly applicable a decade later, particularly given the changes over time discussed in section iv.b.1. above, they provide some suggestive evidence that low-revenue issuers are more likely than other accelerated filers to believe that the costs of complying with sox section 404 substantially outweigh the benefits. in particular, when asked about the net costs or benefits of complying with sox section 404, 30 percent of respondents at an accelerated filer with revenues below $100 million indicated that the costs far outweighed the benefits, in contrast to 14 percent of respondents at an accelerated filer with greater revenues.\\\\402\\\\ however, as noted by a commenter, these survey findings represent the views of issuers and may not be reflective of the views of investors.\\\\403\\\\ \\\\401\\\\ see 2009 sec staff study, note 304 above, and cindy alexander, scott bauguess, gennaro bernile, alex lee, & jennifer marietta-westberg, the economic effects of sox section 404 compliance: a corporate insider perspective, 56 j. of account and econ. 267 (2013) (``alexander et al. 2013 study''). \\\\402\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of data from the 2008-09 survey. the analysis considers responses pertaining to the most recent year for which a given respondent provided a response. we note that the rate of responses to the question about net benefits was lower than for other questions. see the 2009 sec staff study, note 304 above, and alexander et al. 2013 study, note 401 above, for details on the survey and analysis methodology. \\\\403\\\\ see letter from crowe. c. potential reduction in audit fees while issuers disclose their total audit fees, they are not required to disclose the portion of these fees that is attributable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. studies of the initial implementation of the icfr auditor attestation requirement found that it was associated with a roughly 100 percent increase in audit fees for small accelerated filers.\\\\404\\\\ however, these early estimates likely include some initial start-up costs, which were found to diminish over time.\\\\405\\\\ further, these estimates do not incorporate the effect of later developments such as the adoption of as 2201, which was expected to reduce compliance costs for smaller issuers, and the adoption of the new risk assessment auditing standards, which may reduce the incremental cost of an integrated audit over a financial-statement only audit. \\\\404\\\\ see, e.g., william kinney & marcy shepardson, do control effectiveness disclosures require sox 404(b) internal control audits? a natural experiment with small you.s. public companies, 49(2) j. of account. res. 413 (2011) (``kinney and shepardson 2011 study'') (considering those accelerated filers that have newly crossed the $75 million public float threshold in a given year); iliev 2010 study, note 376 above (considering those accelerated filers with between $75 million and $100 million in public float); michael ettredge, matthew sherwood, & lili sun, effects of sox 404(b) implementation on audit fees by sec filer size category, 37 (1) j. of account. and pub. pol'y 21 (2017) (considering accelerated filers as a category, as opposed to large accelerated filers, but also finding a contemporaneous 42.7 percent increase in audit fees for non- accelerated filers even though were not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement); and susan elridge & burch kealey, sox costs: auditor attestation under section 404, working paper (2005), available at (considering accelerated filers in the lowest quintile of total assets). \\\\405\\\\ see, e.g., alexander et al. 2013 study, note 401 above. in the proposing release, we presented an analysis of audit fees from 2014-2017 for low-revenue issuers that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement compared to low-revenue issuers not subject to this requirement.\\\\406\\\\ in particular, we compared audit fees in these recent years for accelerated filers that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement and have revenues of less than $100 million, relative to the audit fees of issuers in our comparison populations (non-accelerated filers, other than egcs, and egcs, neither of which is required to comply with the icfr auditor attestation requirement) \\\\407\\\\ that also have revenues of less than $100 million. based on this analysis, and with consideration for the difference in size of the affected issuers versus the comparison sample, we derived a percentage estimate of 25 percent of total audit fees, and a dollar estimate of about $110,000 per year, that would be saved by issuers newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\408\\\\ as discussed in more detail in the proposing release, the percentage estimate is generally consistent with the estimates, ranging from approximately five to 35 percent of total audit fees, from a variety of other analyses using data from after the 2007 change in the icfr auditing standard. \\\\406\\\\ see section iii.c.3.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\407\\\\ the proposing release, note 4 above, provides more information on why we rely on these comparison populations, how they compare to the affected issuers, and how differences between the comparison populations and the affected issuers could affect our inference. see section iii.c.2. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\408\\\\ see section iii.c.3.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. several commenters indicated that the expected cost savings are difficult to accurately quantify.\\\\409\\\\ we acknowledge that, as discussed in more detail in the proposing release, our estimate is subject to significant uncertainty.\\\\410\\\\ however, these commenters did not provide alternative methodologies or data for obtaining an estimate of the average savings. one recent study focusing on low public float issuers separately considered the subset of issuers with less than $100 million in revenues in their sample and estimated that an exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement would result in an audit fee savings of $135,000 per year for these issuers.\\\\411\\\\ while this analysis was focused on lower float issuers, it is generally supportive of the order of magnitude of our estimate. one commenter questioned whether our estimate considers the incremental costs associated with an audit approach that does not have the benefit of a related audit of icfr.\\\\412\\\\ we note that our analysis is intended to capture this effect, as the issuers in the comparison samples which we use to derive our estimate generally require this type of an audit approach because they are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. \\\\409\\\\ see, e.g., letters from ey, grant thornton, and rsm. \\\\410\\\\ see section iii.c.3.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\411\\\\ see mccallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above. \\\\412\\\\ see letter from bdo. we therefore maintain, without change, our estimate of $110,000 in average audit fee savings per year per affected issuer that would be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. as noted in the proposing release, the audit fee savings are expected to vary across the affected issuers, with some experiencing smaller savings and some experiencing much larger savings depending on their individual circumstances. in line with this expectation, several commenters insisted that any reductions in audit fees resulting from the amendments would depend on facts and circumstances and vary widely among issuers.\\\\413\\\\ consistent with these costs savings being highly varied, a number of commenters to the proposing release provided estimates of costs that specific issuers had incurred or expected to save ranging from $40,000 per year to costs of over $2 million dollars, though most of these estimates include costs other than audit fees (which are discussed below), some include one-time start-up costs as well as ongoing annual costs, and the largest estimate includes costs attributable to sox section 404(a) and other sox requirements.\\\\414\\\\ similarly, a few of the commenters to the src proposing release cited costs of $400,000 to over $1 million associated with the icfr auditor attestation requirement (though it is possible that these estimates also include costs other than audit fees).\\\\415\\\\ \\\\413\\\\ see, e.g., letters from ey, grant thornton, and pwc. \\\\414\\\\ see letters from cerecor (estimating a total of $1 million in expected savings for 2020 associated with an exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement), concert (estimating expected audit fees associated with the icfr auditor attestation requirement to represent approximately 45 percent of its total audit fees), guaranty (estimating future annual costs of $40,000 in personnel and external audit costs associated with ongoing compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement, as well as a higher estimate of costs expended for their first year of compliance in 2018 of $167,745 in audit fees as well as $72,000 and 2,340 labor hours expended across the issuer's accounting, information technology and risk management offices), pieris (estimating that their first year of compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement would be associated with a total of $1.5 million in costs), syros (estimating that its expected additional costs for compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement would range from $250,000 to $400,000 per year, including incremental external auditor fees, consultant fees, and an increased burden on employee resources), and terra tech (estimating over $2 million in costs expended in 2018 for meeting all of its sox compliance requirements, including but not limited to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, representing costs to build a new information technology infrastructure, to hire new staff and consultants, and to pay auditing fees). \\\\415\\\\ see note 208 of the proposing release, note 4 above. one commenter noted that the requirement to implement scaled, risk- based audits of icfr should already result in an appropriately reduced cost of the icfr auditor attestation requirement for many affected issuers.\\\\416\\\\ we note that our quantitative methodology is intended to reflect the current cost of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, including the benefits of scaling. also, while the adoption of as 2201 in 2007, which facilitated the scaling of audits of icfr, was found to have initially led to lower audit fees, there is evidence that these costs began to increase again around the year 2010.\\\\417\\\\ \\\\416\\\\ see letter from cfa. \\\\417\\\\ see section iv.b.1. above. finally, we note that some issuers may voluntarily choose to continue to make these expenditures if they deem the benefits of the icfr auditor attestation to exceed the cost, and that the extent of savings may be affected if auditors continue to test the operating effectiveness of some controls as part of their financial statement audit. in such cases, the audit fee savings may be reduced, but we would expect the potential costs of expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement to be correspondingly lower as well. d. additional potential compliance cost savings the icfr auditor attestation requirement is associated with other compliance costs beyond audit fees, including outside vendor costs and internal labor costs.\\\\418\\\\ however, these costs are difficult to measure because they are not required to be reported. practitioner studies based on surveys of issuers often report non-audit costs of the internal control assessment and reporting requirements of sox section 404 in particular or of sox in general, but the costs attributable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement versus the sox section 404(a) management icfr reporting requirements or other requirements are generally not broken out separately.\\\\419\\\\ \\\\418\\\\ see, e.g., leuz and wysocki 2016 study, note 396 above. \\\\419\\\\ see, e.g., protiviti 2018 report, note 317 above (finding, for example, total internal costs associated with all aspects of sox compliance to be $282,900 for 2018 for respondents with less than $100 million in revenues) and sox & internal controls professionals group, moss adams llp, and workiva (2017), ``2017 state of the sox internal controls market survey'' (``2017 sicpg survey report''), available at . the proposing release presented an analysis of data from the 2008- 09 survey on the non-audit costs of sox section 404 in general, such as outside vendor costs, labor, and non-labor costs (such as software, hardware and travel costs), as well as the percentage of the outside vendor costs and labor hours that were attributable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. based on this analysis, we estimated that the average non-audit costs attributable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement at the time of the survey were approximately $125,000 per year.\\\\420\\\\ adjusting this historical cost downward slightly to account for the fact that some of these expenditures may now be required even in the case of a financial statement only audit (due to the risk assessment auditing standards issued subsequent to this survey), we estimated that the average non-audit costs attributable to the icfr auditor attestation requirement are currently approximately $100,000 per year.\\\\421\\\\ as noted in the proposing release, this estimate is subject to uncertainty because it is unclear exactly how the current costs may differ from the survey responses a decade ago, and the costs may be different for low-revenue issuers. \\\\420\\\\ see section iii.c.3.c. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\421\\\\ id. commenters did not provide alternative methodologies for obtaining an estimate of the average non audit-fee savings. one recent study focusing on low public float issuers considered the potential effect of the icfr auditor attestation requirement on selling, general and administrative (``sg&a'') expenses other than audit fees, and concluded that there was an association with an increase in these internal costs, but was unable to reliably estimate the magnitude of this effect.\\\\422\\\\ we therefore maintain, without change, our estimate of $100,000 in average non-audit compliance cost savings per year per affected issuer that would be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. \\\\422\\\\ see mccallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above. as in the case of audit fees, some of the affected issuers are expected to experience lower cost savings while others would experience greater savings, depending on their individual circumstances. for example, we noted in the proposing release that some issuers had reported potential cost savings other than audit fees ranging from about $110,000 to about $350,000.\\\\423\\\\ while commenters to the proposing release generally did not separately break out these non- audit costs, they reported total costs including audit fees but also internal labor and consultant costs ranging from $40,000 to over $2 million, though, as noted above, some include one-time start-up costs as well as ongoing annual costs, and the largest estimate includes costs attributable to sox section 404(a) and other sox requirements.\\\\424\\\\ \\\\423\\\\ see note 211 of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\424\\\\ see letters from cerecor, guaranty, pieris, syros, and terra tech, as discussed in more detail in above note 414. see also ardelyx presentation, citing the bio study, note 69 above. e. implications of the cost savings while we estimate the average compliance cost associated with the icfr auditor attestation requirement for the affected issuers, it is more difficult to discern whether incurring the costs of this requirement represents the most effective use of funds for these issuers. as discussed in section iv.c.3.c. below, issuers for whom the requirement is eliminated may determine that it is worthwhile to use these funds to voluntarily undergo an audit of icfr.\\\\425\\\\ alternatively, some of these issuers could directly invest the compliance cost savings in improving their operations and prospects for growth, or in their control systems. \\\\425\\\\ see letter from bio (supporting allowing ``issuers and their investors the flexibility to determine for themselves whether section 404(b) is relevant to their business''). in total, we estimate an average cost savings of $210,000 per issuer per year, with some of the affected issuers experiencing lesser or greater savings.\\\\426\\\\ while a few commenters noted that icfr auditor attestations have become less expensive over time \\\\427\\\\ or that they should already be less expensive for the affected issuers due to the ability to scale the audit of icfr,\\\\428\\\\ we note that our analysis, using only recent years of data and low-revenue issuers, is intended to capture any such effects. \\\\426\\\\ as noted above, this estimate is not intended to apply to affected issuers that would not otherwise be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement (i.e., egcs) or that would remain subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement (i.e., banks with assets of over $1 billion). \\\\427\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa inst. and deloitte. \\\\428\\\\ see letter from cfa. several commenters argued that these cost savings are economically small.\\\\429\\\\ in particular, they estimated that the savings represent 0.5 percent of the average affected issuer's revenue and 0.1 percent of its market value.\\\\430\\\\ similarly, many commenters asserted that the proposed amendments would not enhance capital formationand some indicated they could even reduce capital formation.\\\\431\\\\ others noted that, in general, the costs of the icfr auditor attestation requirement are substantial,\\\\432\\\\ and that by eliminating the requirement for certain issuers, the proposed amendments would enhance capital formation or allow those issuers to preserve capital.\\\\433\\\\ we continue to believe that the average expected savings is likely, in many cases, to represent a meaningful cost savings for issuers with less than $100 million in revenue and may thus have beneficial economic effects on competition and capital formation. \\\\429\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., cii, and prof. barth et al. \\\\430\\\\ we obtain similar estimates. specifically, we estimate that the annual savings represents of 0.7 percent of the median revenue and 0.1 percent of the median market capitalization of the affected issuers that would be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements. we note, however, that 12 percent of these issuers have zero revenues, and that the savings are estimated for a single year while market capitalization incorporates expectations regarding all future years of performance. \\\\431\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cii, cfa, and prof. ge et al. see also cfa inst. (stating that the proposing release, note 4 above, does not demonstrate that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement would enhance capital formation). \\\\432\\\\ see, e.g., letters from bio, broadmark, carver, guaranty, icba, msb, ssb, and syros. \\\\433\\\\ see, e.g., letters from andersen, clsa, concert, icba, and nasba. in particular, while the average annual cost savings may represent a small percentage of the average affected issuers' revenues and market capitalizations, it is significant relative to the income and cash flows of these issuers. as noted in the proposing release, low-revenue issuers are likely to face financing constraints because they do not have access to internally-generated capital.\\\\434\\\\ a majority of the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement, and that will not be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement, have negative net income and negative net cash flows from operations.\\\\435\\\\ in the absence of significant income generation, the average savings of $210,000 per year may be likely to be put to productive use,\\\\436\\\\ such as towards capital investments, which would enhance capital formation. a number of issuers commented that they anticipated that the savings would allow for increased investment in their core business.\\\\437\\\\ also, while some issuers may experience lesser savings, some commented that they expect to experience substantially greater savings,\\\\438\\\\ so the cost savings are likely to be significant for some, even if not all, of the affected issuers. \\\\434\\\\ for example, the proposing release, note 4 above, cited one commenter that indicated that ``pre-revenue small businesses utilize only investment dollars to fund their work'' and that any cost savings thus ``could lead to funding for a new life-saving medicine.'' see note 213 of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\435\\\\ see note 362 above. \\\\436\\\\ for example, in a survey of issuers in the biotech industry, among 11 biotech egcs that responded to a question regarding how an extension of the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement would affect them given the costs associated with the requirement, eight out of the 11 issuers indicated that they expected a positive impact on investments in research and development and six out of the 11 issuers indicated that they expected a positive impact on hiring employees. see bio study, note 69 above. \\\\437\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cerecor, concert, guaranty, pieris and syros. \\\\438\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cerecor, corvus, and terratech, estimating savings of $1 to $2 million. further, several commenters cited fixed costs of compliance that do not scale with size.\\\\439\\\\ because of the fixed costs component of compliance costs, smaller issuers generally bear proportionately higher compliance costs than larger issuers.\\\\440\\\\ to illustrate this disparity, we estimated in the proposing release that total audit fees represent about 22 percent of revenues on average for accelerated filers with less than $100 million in revenues, versus 0.5 percent of revenue for those above $100 million in revenues.\\\\441\\\\ reducing the affected issuers' costs would reduce their overhead expenses and may enhance their ability to compete with larger issuers. \\\\439\\\\ see letters from asa, broadmark, chamber, and guaranty. \\\\440\\\\ while it is difficult to identify the specific source of the fixed component of compliance costs, there is empirical evidence of such fixed costs based on differences in the ratio of such costs to measures of issuer size across issuer size categories. for example, the ratio of the costs for accelerated filers of complying with section 404 to the book value of the issuer's assets decreases with issuer size. see, e.g., figure 1 of alexander et al. 2013 study, note 401 above. there is evidence of some such fixed costs persisting even after the 2007 change in the icfr auditing standard facilitating the scaling of an audit of icfr, as demonstrated by the results in the cited figure for issuers that had been complying with section 404(b) for five years (as observations in the figure pertaining to lesser years of experience may include costs experienced by some issuers in years prior to the 2007 changes). \\\\441\\\\ see section iii.c.2.d. of the proposing release, note 4 above. the alleviation of these costs could be a positive factor in the decision of additional companies to enter public markets.\\\\442\\\\ that is, if future compliance costs associated with icfr auditor attestations weigh against these companies becoming publicly traded, reducing these expected future costs may enhance capital formation in the public markets and the efficient allocation of capital at the market level. as noted above, the expected compliance cost savings are likely to vary across issuers. the amendments may be most likely to influence the decision to enter the public markets for companies that anticipate particularly high costs to obtain an icfr auditor attestation and that expect low levels of revenue to persist for many years into the future. \\\\442\\\\ see, e.g., letter from icba. some commenters suggested that the amendments would encourage companies to enter the public markets.\\\\443\\\\ on the other hand, other commenters maintained that the icfr auditor attestation requirement does not prevent companies from entering the public markets.\\\\444\\\\ \\\\443\\\\ see, e.g., letters from advamed, advamed et al., broadmark, cerecor, and icba. \\\\444\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., cii, and crowe. research investigating the link between sox and companies exiting or choosing not to enter public markets has been inconclusive.\\\\445\\\\ we agree with commenters who stated that a number of other factors have been associated with the decline in listings.\\\\446\\\\ further, newly public issuers can already avail themselves of an exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement for at least one and generally up to five years after their ipo.\\\\447\\\\ while the amendments could be a positive factor in the decision of additional companies to enter public markets, it may not be the decisive factor, and the direct impact of the amendments on the number of publicly traded companies may be limited to the extent that companies may be more focused on other factors associated with the decision to go public. \\\\445\\\\ there is some evidence of a decreased rate of ipos and an increased rate of going private transactions and deregistrations in the united states after sox. however, it is unclear to what extent these changes can be attributed to sox (or to the auditor attestation requirement in particular) versus other factors, and to what extent these changes are a because for concern. see e.g., coates and srinivasan 2014 study, note 369 above, at 636-640 (summarizing a number of studies in this area). \\\\446\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., cii, and crowe. other factors commenters cited include the expansion of exemptions to registration that increase companies' ability to raise funds privately, see, e.g., letters from cfa, cii, and crowe; corporate consolidations, see, e.g., letters from cfa and cii; market conditions, see letter from cfa; and the general regulatory environment, see letter from crowe. \\\\447\\\\ see note 11 above regarding the exemption of egcs from the auditor attestation requirement. 3. potential costs of expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement for affected issuers exempting the affected issuers from the icfr auditor attestation requirement may result, over time, in management at this category of issuers being less likely to maintain effective icfr, which in turn may result in less reliable financial statements, on average, for these issuers. the discussion below explores this potential effect and its implications in detail. we also consider two mitigating factors that could be associated with the affected issuers on average, though we acknowledge that they may not apply equally to all of the affected issuers. first, low-revenue issuers may, on average, be less susceptible to the risk of certain kinds of misstatements, such as errors associated with revenue recognition.\\\\448\\\\ second, in many cases, the market value of such issuers may be driven to a greater degree by their future prospects than by the current period's financial statements, which may affect how, on average, investors use these issuers' financial statements. this discussion is focused on affected issuers that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement and will not be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement. \\\\448\\\\ see bio study, note 69 above (finding that biotechnology egcs have lower restatement frequencies than other issuers, after controlling for other factors, and attributing this to their ``absence of product revenue'' based on findings that revenue recognition is one of the most frequent drivers of financial restatements). exempting the affected issuers from the icfr auditor attestation requirement could also increase the risk that material weaknesses in icfr may not be detected and disclosed, and thereby reduce the information available to investors for gauging the reliability of these issuers' financial statements. in this regard, we also discuss below the potential effects related to the identification and disclosure of material weaknesses in icfr at the affected issuers. however, given the size of the estimated effect as well as recent findings discussed in section iv.c.3.a. below on how icfr auditor attestations may provide limited information about the risk of future restatements,\\\\449\\\\ we believe that any such effect would not significantly affect investors' overall ability to make informed investment decisions. \\\\449\\\\ see notes 453 through 459 below and accompanying text. a. broad considerations and evidence regarding the effects of icfr auditor attestations on financial reporting this section summarizes a number of broad economic considerations related to the possible effects of an icfr auditor attestation requirement on financial reporting in order to provide context for the more detailed analysis of the costs of exempting the affected parties from this requirement that follows. as discussed below, the anticipated effects of changes to the population of issuers subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement will depend on the characteristics of the specific group of issuers that will be affected. in this regard we note that prior research has not focused on the effects of the icfr auditor attestation requirement on low-revenue issuers in particular. as discussed in section iv.b.1., there also have been significant changes over time in the implementation of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, the standards applying to a financial statement audit even in the absence of an audit of icfr, and the execution of audits of financial statements and of icfr, which may have had the effect of reducing both the incremental costs and incremental benefits of an icfr auditor attestation since the periods studied in much of the existing research. we therefore acknowledge that, while we believe that consideration of the past research is an important part of our analysis, these factors limit our ability to rely on the findings of past research to predict how the amendments would affect the particular class of issuers implicated by this rulemaking. icfr auditor attestations can have two primary types of benefits. first, the icfr auditor attestation reports can provide incremental information to investors about the reliability of the financial statements. second, the reliability of the financial statements can be enhanced. that is, the expectation of, or process involved in, the icfr auditor attestation could lead issuers to maintain better controls, which could lead to more reliable financial reporting. importantly for our evaluation of these possible benefits, however, we do not directly observe the effectiveness of icfr and the reliability of financial statements, but only the associated disclosures by issuers. for example, while restatements may indicate that controls have failed, such restatements are often predicated on the underlying misstatements being detected. given such limitations with the available data, the analysis in existing studies and in this release is necessarily less than definitive. regarding the first possible benefit of icfr auditor attestations, academic research provides some evidence that icfr auditor attestation reports contain information about the reliability of financial statements, but also demonstrates that the incremental information provided by these reports may be limited. the 2011 sec staff study summarizes evidence that icfr auditor attestations generally resulted in the identification and disclosure of material weaknesses that were not previously identified or whose severity was misclassified when identified by management in its assessment of icfr, and that investor risk assessments and investment decisions were associated with the findings in auditor attestation reports.\\\\450\\\\ as noted by a commenter,\\\\451\\\\ various survey results are also supportive of these reports being informative to investors.\\\\452\\\\ \\\\450\\\\ see 2011 sec staff study, note 198 above, at 97-99 and 102-104. see also coates and srinivasan 2014 study, note 369 above. \\\\451\\\\ see letter from cii. \\\\452\\\\ see lawrence brown, andrew call, michael clement, and nathan sharp, the activities of buy-side analysts and the determinants of their stock recommendations, 62 j. of account. and econ. 139 (2016) (finding, in a survey of buy-side analysts, that 60 percent responded that material weaknesses in icfr are definitely a red flag of management potentially misrepresenting financial results, and that the existence of a material weakness in icfr was the most cited red flag for misrepresentation followed by weak corporate governance; however, this survey did not differentiate between firms subject or not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement). however, more recent studies have found that auditor identification of material weaknesses in icfr tends to be concurrent with the disclosure of restatements, rather than providing advance warning of the potential for restatements.\\\\453\\\\ while these findings do not imply that icfr auditor attestation reports fail to provide any useful information about the risk of future restatements,\\\\454\\\\ they demonstrate that this information may be limited. further, researchers have been able to predict the identification by auditors of material weaknesses in icfr beyond those identified by management, to some extent, by using otherwise available information about issuers beyond current restatements, such as their institutional ownership, aggregate losses, past restatements, and late filings.\\\\455\\\\ one commenter notes that this predictability does not imply that there is limited incremental information provided by icfr auditor attestation reports, as their analysis suggests that investors are not able to fully discern misreporting by issuers about their icfr.\\\\456\\\\ still, we believe that the evidence suggests that markets at least partially, though perhaps not fully, incorporate this information even in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\457\\\\ limitations to the incremental information provided by icfr auditor attestation reports about the risk of future restatements may result from disincentives, such as the increased risk of litigation and greater likelihood of management and auditor turnover that have been associated with earlier material weakness disclosures, for issuers and their auditors to disclose material weaknesses in the absence of restatements.\\\\458\\\\ it may also result from issues with the quality of the audit of icfr. in this regard, researchers have found that pcaob scrutiny of these audits has been associated with a slightly higher rate of identification of material weaknesses in icfr prior to a later restatement.\\\\459\\\\ \\\\453\\\\ see, e.g., sarah rice & david weber, how effective is internal control reporting under sox 404? determinants of the (non- )disclosure of existing material weaknesses, 50(3) j. of account. res. 811 (2012); william kinney, roger martin, &

2011 sec staff study, note 198 above, at 86 (citing evidence that while both issuers subject to sox section 404(b) as well as those only subject to sox section 404(a) often report restatements despite previously reporting that their icfr was effective, such restatements were 46 percent higher among those filing only sox section 404(a) reports). see also pcaob investor advisory group, report from the working group on the investor survey (2015), available at (reporting survey findings that 72 percent of institutional investors indicated that they relied on icfr auditor attestations either ``extensively'' or ``a good bit''). \\\\455\\\\ see, e.g., ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above. \\\\456\\\\ see letter from prof. ge et al. \\\\457\\\\ see, e.g., h. ashbaugh-skaife, d. collins, w.

companies that newly disclose material weaknesses in their icfr have an increase in their cost of capital, but that this increase is lower for companies with the characteristics most associated with having such material weaknesses, i.e., those for which the market may be least surprised by the disclosures, at about 50 basis points, and higher for companies without such characteristics, at about 125 basis points). \\\\458\\\\ see sarah rice, david weber, & biyu wu, does sox 404 have teeth? consequences of the failure to report existing internal control weaknesses, 90(3) account. rev. 1169 (2015). we note that auditors have a duty to follow auditing standards and, if they do not, face associated enforcement, inspection, reputation, and litigation risks that provide a countervailing incentive. \\\\459\\\\ see, e.g., defond and lennox 2017 study, note 307 above (finding that pcaob inspections may increase auditors' issuance of adverse internal control opinions to clients with later restatements; in particular, the study documents that in 2010, 96 percent of financial statements that were later restated were accompanied by icfr auditor attestations disclosing no material weaknesses in icfr, while this rate dropped to 91 percent by 2013). a further reason why icfr auditor attestation reports may provide only a weak warning about future restatements is that the audit of icfr may contribute to the avoidance of misstatements, leading us to observe only the residual restatements where the misstatement risk was not foreseen or a misstatement was not detected for reasons unrelated to internal controls. thus, the second possible benefit we consider is that the audit of icfr may encourage management to maintain more effective controls and thereby deter accounting errors and fraud. the academic research discussed below documents substantial evidence that would be consistent with such effects, though, as is common in financial economics, it is difficult to determine whether the documented differences can be causally linked to the audit of icfr.\\\\460\\\\ \\\\460\\\\ see coates and srinivasan 2014 study, note 369 above, and leuz and wysocki 2016 study, note 396 above (both articles discussing the limited ability to make causal attribution based on research on the effects of the provisions of sox, but also highlighting the specific studies that can more plausibly make causal claims). see also report to congress: access to capital and market liquidity, august 2017 sec staff study 24-27 (discussing similar limitations, in a different context, in the ability to make causal inferences about the effects of regulation because of data and experimental design issues), available at . in particular, while issuers are subject to a number of requirements discussed above that are intended to help to provide adequate internal controls and reliable financial statements,\\\\461\\\\ studies have documented a significant association between audits of icfr and the maintenance of better internal controls. the 2011 sec staff study provides analysis and summarizes research indicating that issuers that were not required to obtain an icfr auditor attestation disclosed ineffective icfr at a greater rate than those that were subject to such requirements,\\\\462\\\\ and newer studies demonstrate that this difference has remained consistent in recent years.\\\\463\\\\ further, a recent paper finds that the icfr auditor attestation requirement, but not management icfr reporting requirements alone, are associated with enhanced quarterly earnings accrual quality, and argues that this is an indication of the improved quality of internal controls.\\\\464\\\\ we note, however, that this study finds that the improvements for issuers subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement are attenuated after the 2007 change in the icfr auditing standard discussed in section iv.b.1. above.\\\\465\\\\ the icfr auditor attestation requirement has also been associated with a higher rate of remediation of material weaknesses after they are disclosed.\\\\466\\\\ as noted by a commenter,\\\\467\\\\ survey evidence is also consistent with this requirement being associated with more effective icfr. for example, this commenter cites a recent survey of public companies that found that 57 percent responded that one of the primary benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement was ``improved internal control over financial reporting (icfr) structure.'' \\\\468\\\\ \\\\461\\\\ see section iv.b.1. above. \\\\462\\\\ see 2011 sec staff study, note 198 above, at 41 and 86-87. the rate of ineffective icfr is based on the findings of management reports on icfr pursuant to sox section 404(a). because auditor attestations of icfr are associated with an increased detection and disclosure of material weaknesses, as discussed above, the rate of ineffective icfr reported by issuers not subject to the auditor attestation requirement may be understated, which would result in this difference also being understated. \\\\463\\\\ see, e.g., audit analytics, sox 404 disclosures: a fourteen year review (sept. 2018) (``2018 audit

more effective icfr, this requirement may thereby lead to more reliable financial statements. some studies have found that a failure to maintain effective icfr has been associated with a higher rate of future restatements and lower earnings quality,\\\\469\\\\ a higher rate of future fraud revelations,\\\\470\\\\ more profitable insider trading,\\\\471\\\\ and less accurate analyst forecasts.\\\\472\\\\ \\\\469\\\\ see coates and srinivasan 2014 study, note 369 above, at 649-650. \\\\470\\\\ see dain donelson, matthew ege, & john mcinnis, internal control weaknesses and

attestations.\\\\473\\\\ we note, however, that two recent studies, using different methodologies, find evidence that conflicts with these other studies. in particular, the evidence in these studies, which use data from 2007 through 2013 \\\\474\\\\ and 2014,\\\\475\\\\ respectively, does not support the conclusion that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is associated with more reliable financial statements, and one of the studies \\\\476\\\\ even finds an association with lower reliability, consistent with concerns discussed in section iv.b.1. above that the quality of audits of icfr dropped at least temporarily after 2007. \\\\473\\\\ see 2011 sec staff study, note 198 above, at 98-100. for more recent evidence, see, e.g., yuping zhao, jean bedard, & rani hoitash, sox 404,

attestation under sox section 404 and earnings informativeness, 32(1) auditing: a j. of prac. & theory 61 (2013). \\\\474\\\\ see bhaskar et al. 2018 study, note 305 above (finding that, among companies with less than $150 million in market capitalization, those providing auditor attestations of icfr, whether voluntarily or because they are accelerated filers, had a higher rate of material misstatements and lower earnings quality than others in this category in the period from 2007 through 2013). \\\\475\\\\ see mccallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above (finding that, among companies with close to $75 million in public float, those above this threshold, which are likely subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, do not experience lower restatements than those below this threshold in the period from 2007 through 2015). \\\\476\\\\ see bhaskar et al. 2018 study, note 305 above. to evaluate the economic implications of any effects the icfr auditor attestation requirement has on icfr and financial statements, we can consider factors such as production or investment at the issuer or market level. for example, at the issuer level, more reliable disclosures are generally expected, based on economic theory, to lead investors to demand a lower expected return to hold an issuer's securities (i.e., a lower cost of capital).\\\\477\\\\ a lower cost of capital may enhance capital formation by encouraging issuers to issue additional securities in order to raise funds for new investments. empirically, material weaknesses in icfr,\\\\478\\\\ restatements,\\\\479\\\\ and low earnings quality \\\\480\\\\ have all been associated with a higher cost of debt or equity \\\\481\\\\ capital. \\\\477\\\\ see, e.g., douglas diamond & robert verrecchia, disclosure, liquidity, and the cost of capital, 46(4) j. of fin. 1325 (1991) (``diamond and verrecchia 1991 study''); david easley & maureen o'hara, `information and the cost of capital,'

armstrong, john core, daniel taylor, & robert verrecchia, when does information asymmetry affect the cost of capital? 49(1) j. of account. res. 1 (2011). we note that these articles also detail limited theoretical circumstances under which more reliable disclosures could lead to a higher cost of capital, such as in the case where improved disclosure is sufficient to reduce incentives for market making. \\\\478\\\\ see, e.g., dragon tang, feng tian, & hong yan, internal control quality and credit default swap spreads, 29(3) account. horizons 603 (2015); lawrence gordon & amanda

study, note 457 above. we note that earlier work did not detect an association between sox section 404 material weaknesses and the equity cost of capital. see, e.g., m. ogneva, k. r. subramanyam, & k. rachunandan, internal control weakness and cost of equity: evidence from sox section 404 disclosures, 82(5) account. rev. 1255 (2007) (``ogneva et al. 2007 study''). see also 2011 sec staff study,

967 (2004) (``francis et al. 2004 study''). \\\\481\\\\ we note that empirical studies of the cost of equity capital face particular challenges in accurately measuring the cost of equity capital, which can reduce their reliability, but that this is mitigated in studies that look at changes over time, see, e.g., gordon and wilford 2012 study, note 478 above; ashbaugh-skaife et al. 2009 study, note 457 above; and hribar and jenkins 2004 study, note 479 above, rather than in the cross-section. see, e.g., ogneva et al. 2007 study, note 478 above, and francis et al. 2004 study, note 480 above. see also, e.g., stephannie larocque & matthew r. lyle, implied cost of equity capital estimates as predictors of accounting returns and stock returns, 2(1) j. of fin. rep. 69 (2017) (discussing concerns about measures of the cost of equity capital); and charles m. c. lee, eric c. so, & charles c. y. wang, evaluating firm-level expected-return proxies, harvard business school working paper 15-022 (2017) (finding that ``in the vast majority of research settings, biases in [equity cost of capital measures] are irrelevant'' and that the cost of equity capital measures used in the accounting literature ``are particularly useful in tracking time-series variations in expected returns''). more effective icfr and more reliable financial reporting may also lead to improved efficiency of production if managers themselves thereby have access to more reliable data that facilitates better operating and investing decisions.\\\\482\\\\ for example, one study finds that the investment efficiency of issuers improves, in that both under- investment and over-investment are curtailed, after the disclosure and remediation of material weaknesses.\\\\483\\\\ another study finds that issuers that remediate material weaknesses in icfr that are related to inventory tracking thereafter experience higher inventory turnover, together with improvements in sales and profitability.\\\\484\\\\ that said, it is difficult to generalize the results beyond these samples to determine whether non-remediating issuers or issuers with different types of material weaknesses in icfr could expect similar operational benefits from remediation. the icfr auditor attestation requirement may also result in benefits at the market level, though these are more difficult to measure than those at the issuer level.\\\\485\\\\ the potential for market-level impact is largely driven by network effects (which are associated with the broad adoption of practices) and by other externalities (i.e., spillover effects on issuers or parties beyond the issuer in question). for example, to the extent that the icfr auditor attestation requirement leads to more reliable financial statements at a large number of issuers, it may lead to a more efficient allocation of capital across different investment opportunities at the market level.\\\\486\\\\ the icfr auditor attestation requirement also can enhance capital formation to the extent that it improves overall investor confidence, for which there is some suggestive evidence,\\\\487\\\\ and thus encourages investment in public markets.\\\\488\\\\ \\\\482\\\\ see, e.g., ge et al. 2017 study at 359, note 393 above (arguing that internal control misreporting leads to lower operating performance due to the non-remediation of ineffective controls, and estimating the degree of such underperformance based on the improvement shown by issuers that are non-accelerated filers after disclosing and remediating material weaknesses, relative to other such issuers that are suspected of having unreported material weaknesses). \\\\483\\\\ see mei cheng, dan dhaliwal, & yuan zheng, does investment efficiency

evidence is central to the economic justification of regulation'' and acknowledging that ``the identification of such market-wide effects and externalities is even more difficult than the identification of direct economic consequences on individual firms''). \\\\486\\\\ there is also some evidence that more reliable financial disclosures also facilitate a more effective market for corporate control, which can increase overall market discipline and thus enhance the efficiency of production by incentivizing more effective management. see amir amel-zadeh & yuan zhang, the economic consequences of financial restatements: evidence from the market for corporate control, 90(1) account. rev. 1 (2015). see also vidhi chhaochharia, clemens otto, & vikrant vig, the unintended effects

requirement raised investor confidence in their own company). \\\\488\\\\ for a further discussion of potential externalities, see coates and srinivasan 2014 study, note 369 above, at 657-659. many commenters cited the benefits that have been ascribed to the icfr auditor attestation requirement in general and attested to their importance. for example, some stated that the icfr auditor attestation requirement promotes more effective icfr and more accurate icfr disclosures,\\\\489\\\\ including a greater likelihood and timeliness of disclosing ineffective or weak icfr,\\\\490\\\\ and that effective icfr leads to better and more reliable financial statements,\\\\491\\\\ audit quality,\\\\492\\\\ and analyst forecasts \\\\493\\\\ as well as fewer restatements, misstatements,\\\\494\\\\ and instances of fraud and insider trading.\\\\495\\\\ others more directly linked the icfr auditor attestation requirement with enhanced transparency,\\\\496\\\\ a higher quality and reliability of issuers' financial statements,\\\\497\\\\ and corporate governance \\\\498\\\\ and a reduced number of restatements, misstatements,\\\\499\\\\ and instances of fraud.\\\\500\\\\ some commenters noted that the icfr auditor attestation requirement increases investor confidence generally \\\\501\\\\ and that investors view the requirement as beneficial.\\\\502\\\\ \\\\489\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cfa, cii, crowe, grant thornton, prof. barth et al., and pwc. \\\\490\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cfa, crowe,

benefits, at both the issuer and market level, likely vary across issuers of different types. for example, younger, loss-incurring issuers with lower market capitalization and lower institutional ownership, as well as those with more segments, tend to be more likely to newly disclose material weaknesses as they transition into the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\503\\\\ however, the market appears to account for the association of material weaknesses with these and other observable issuer characteristics. thus, issuers that have the characteristics associated with a higher rate of material weaknesses (and which investors may therefore value under the assumption that they are likely to have ineffective icfr) but that receive an auditor attestation report that does not report any material weaknesses are found to have the greatest cost of capital benefit from such a report.\\\\504\\\\ small, loss-incurring issuers are also disproportionately represented amongst issuers that have allegedly engaged in financial disclosure frauds, indicating that any benefits in terms of investor protection and investor confidence may be particularly important for this population of issuers.\\\\505\\\\ on the other hand, marginal changes in the reliability of the financial statements of issuers whose valuation is driven primarily by their future prospectswhich could also include small, loss-incurring issuerscould have limited issuer- and market-level effects to the extent that the current financial statements of these issuers are less critical to assessing their valuation.\\\\506\\\\ \\\\503\\\\ see ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above (regarding the term ``younger,'' this study defines company age as the number of years a company has been covered in the compustat database). see also 2011 sec staff study, note 198 above, at 96 (summarizing previous research finding that internal control deficiencies are associated with smaller, complex, riskier, and more financially- distressed issuers). \\\\504\\\\ see ashbaugh-skaife et al. 2009 study, note 457 above. \\\\505\\\\ see, e.g., coso 2010 fraud study (finding that companies allegedly engaging in

monograph''). b. estimated effects on icfr, the reliability of financial statements, and potential fraud the academic literature discussed in section iv.c.3.a. above suggests that the scrutiny associated with the icfr auditor attestation may lead issuers that are required to obtain this attestation to maintain more effective icfr and to remediate material weaknesses in icfr more quickly, leading to more reliable financial statements. further, as discussed above, studies have highlighted that smaller issuers are disproportionately represented in populations of issuers with ineffective icfr and financial statements that require material restatement. in addition, smaller issuers are less likely to have significant external scrutiny in the form of analyst and media coverage and monitoring by institutional owners,\\\\507\\\\ which could otherwise provide another source of discipline to maintain the reliability of financial statements. however, two of the studies cited above find that the icfr auditor attestation requirement was not associated with more reliable financial statements for lower market capitalization issuers from 2007 through 2013 or 2014,\\\\508\\\\ and the existing studies in general may not be directly applicable to current circumstances given the 2010 change in risk assessment auditing standards, the 2007 change in the icfr auditing standard and other recent changes discussed in section iv.b.1. above. importantly, the existing literature and most of the results cited by commenters regarding the benefits of the icfr auditor attestation also do not directly examine low-revenue issuers. \\\\507\\\\ see, e.g., joel peress & lily fang, media coverage and the cross-section of stock returns, 64(5) j. of fin. 2023 at 2030 (2009) (finding that ``firm

above, and mccallen et al. 2019 study, note 308 above, as discussed in note 475 above. this section therefore provides an analysis of low-revenue issuers using recent data to complement the existing studies and better inform our consideration of the possible costs of the amendments. however, some uncertainty will remain due to the challenges discussed above in measurement and in ascribing causality in any such analysis, the limited sample sizes that result when restricting the analysis to recent years, and the general difficulty of predicting how the parties involved will react to the amendments. as discussed in more detail in the proposing release,\\\\509\\\\ our analysis includes an examination of two comparison populations of issuers that are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement but that otherwise have similar responsibilities with respect to icfr (i.e., non-accelerated filers, other than egcs, and egcs), with consideration given to the ways in which these issuers differ from the affected issuers. \\\\509\\\\ see sections iii.c.2. and iii.c.4. of the proposing release, note 4 above. one commenter suggested that we should more carefully consider the audit risks linked to specific industries that are expected to be affected by the amendments, highlighting the banking industry as one that may have special considerations.\\\\510\\\\ we note that, as discussed above, the majority of the affected banking issuers are expected to remain subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement and therefore are not expected to be significantly affected by the amendments. further, because of the small sample of affected issuers, we have a limited ability to split our sample and maintain statistical reliability. however, our aggregate estimates should reflect the overall diversity in the population of affected issuers. \\\\510\\\\ see letter from cfa inst. another commenter indicated that the primary quantifiable cost of an exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement stems from misreporting regarding the effectiveness of icfr.\\\\511\\\\ while we consider this effect and its quantifiable implications in more detail below, we continue to believe that the incentive provided by the icfr auditor attestation requirement to actually maintain better controls (versus just to more accurately report their status) remains a key benefit with certain quantifiable implications that could be lost due to an exemption from this requirement. \\\\511\\\\ see letter from prof. ge et al. i. effects on the prevalence of ineffective icfr we first consider possible effects related to the effectiveness of the affected issuers' icfr. in the proposing release, we presented an analysis of the rate of ineffective icfr from 2014-2018 among low- revenue issuers that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement compared to low-revenue issuers not subject to this requirement.\\\\512\\\\ in particular, we compared the reported rate of ineffective icfr in these recent years for accelerated filers that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement and have revenues of less than $100 million, relative to the reported rate of ineffective icfr for issuers in our comparison populations (non-accelerated filers, other than egcs, and egcs, neither of which is required to comply with the icfr auditor attestation requirement) that also have revenues of less than $100 million. we focused on sox section 404(a) management reports on icfr, with the caveat that management may not report as many material weaknesses in the absence of an audit of icfr.\\\\513\\\\ based on this analysis, and with consideration for the difference in size, maturity, and overall resources of the affected issuers versus the comparison sample, we estimated that an additional 15 percent of the affected issuers may fail to maintain effective icfr.\\\\514\\\\ we did not receive comment on this specific estimate or comments providing data or methodologies that would improve our estimate. our estimate is consistent with the estimated effect on icfr based on a study of issuers transitioning into the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\515\\\\ we do not expect the full estimated effect to be experienced immediately upon effectiveness of the amendments. instead, as discussed in detail at the end of this section, we expect a movement towards this higher rate of ineffective icfr over time as some of the affected issuers make incremental changes in their investment in icfr and as additional issuers enter the category of affected issuers. \\\\512\\\\ see section iii.c.4.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\513\\\\ we separately consider this potential under-reporting of material weaknesses in the analysis below. \\\\514\\\\ see section iii.c.4.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. we also noted in this section of the proposing release, note 4 above, that our findings may not be surprising, as certain material weaknesses in icfr may be corrected by, for example, hiring additional staff, which managers of an issuer that is not currently producing much revenue may prefer to defer to a later time. indeed, about 80 to 85 percent of the low-revenue issuers reporting ineffective icfr in the comparison populations in 2017 reported at least one staffing-related material weakness, though these were generally accompanied by other types of material weaknesses. see note 259 of the proposing release, note 4 above, and the accompanying text. \\\\515\\\\ see ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above, at 372 (finding that 62.5 percent of companies that reported material weaknesses as non-accelerated filers remediate such weaknesses upon entering accelerated filer status). to compare the result from this study to our estimate, note that we find in table 7 above that about nine percent of accelerated filers report ineffective icfr (further, the proposing release, note 4 above, found that the rate was similar for low and high revenue issuers). our estimate of an additional 15 percentage points of the affected issuers reporting ineffective icfr in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation requirement would lead to a total of 24 percent (nine percent plus 15 percent) of the issuers reporting material weaknesses in icfr in the absence of the requirement as compared to nine percent reporting material weaknesses in icfr when subjected to the requirement. this is the same result one would get by applying the 62.5 percent remediation estimate from the cited study. in other words, if 62.5 percent of the issuers reporting material weaknesses in the absence of the icfr auditor attestation requirement remediated their material weaknesses upon entering accelerated filer status and becoming subject to the requirement, that would mean that the rest of the issuers (37.5 percent) failed to remediate when becoming subject to the requirement. this would imply that a 24 percent rate of ineffective icfr reported by the issuers in the absence of the requirement would correspond to a nine percent rate (24 percent times 37.5 percent) of ineffective icfr reported by the issuers when subjected to the requirement. ii. effects on the detection and disclosure of material weaknesses in icfr because the previous analysis focuses on disclosed rates of ineffective icfr, it does not address the extent to which the amendments may affect the detection and disclosure of material weaknesses in icfr. as discussed in section iv.c.3.a. above, studies have found that audits of icfr often result in the identification and disclosure of material weaknesses that were not previously identified or whose severity was misclassified in management's initial assessment. thus, extending the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement to the affected issuers may decrease the likelihood that, when these issuers have underlying material weaknesses in icfr, these material weaknesses are detected and disclosed. in the proposing release, we noted that low-revenue issuers may be less likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose material weaknesses in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation, perhaps because they have less complex financial systems and controls.\\\\516\\\\ consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the low-revenue issuers that are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement report relatively high rates of ineffective icfr despite these reports not being subject to the additional scrutiny of an icfr auditor attestation. \\\\516\\\\ see 2017 sicpg survey report, note 419 above, at 6 (finding that 33 percent of survey respondents with revenues of $75 million or less reported that they manage no more than 100 total controls, as compared to 13 percent of those with revenues of $76 to $700 million and zero percent of those with revenues greater than $700 million). in the proposing release, we did not quantitatively estimate a potential effect on the detection and disclosure of material weaknesses in icfr, though we did qualitatively consider how the amendments could affect issuers depending on their proclivity to detect and disclose underlying material weaknesses in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\517\\\\ several commenters indicated that they expected the amendments to affect the detection and disclosure of material weaknesses in icfr,\\\\518\\\\ with one stating that ``the primary quantifiable cost of 404(b) attestation exemption arises from internal control misreporting.'' \\\\519\\\\ further, other commenters noted that factors other than the complexity of issuers' systems and controls, such as their accounting personnel resources \\\\520\\\\ or the intricacies of the issuers' business and industry, the strength of their governance, the competency of their management, and their international reach,\\\\521\\\\ should be considered in assessing the risk of misreporting with respect to icfr effectiveness. in response to these comments, we conducted a quantitative estimation of this effect and its potential implications. \\\\517\\\\ see section iii.c.4.c of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\518\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa inst., ey, and prof. ge et al. \\\\519\\\\ see letter from prof. ge et al. \\\\520\\\\ see letters from caq and ey. \\\\521\\\\ see letter from rsm. because undetected and undisclosed material weaknesses cannot be directly observed, we are not able to directly estimate the extent of such issues in our comparison samples of low-revenue issuers that are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. instead, we rely on a recent study that estimates that an incremental 3.5 percent of issuers misreport their icfr as being effective when not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement as compared to when they are subjected to this requirement.\\\\522\\\\ to obtain this estimate, the study uses the characteristics associated with ineffective icfr to predict the actual rate of ineffective icfr as opposed to the disclosed rate of ineffective icfr, and uses changes in reporting around transitions into accelerated filer status to predict the proportion of suspected misreporters that would correctly report under an icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\523\\\\ \\\\522\\\\ see ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above (estimating, based on data from 2007 through 2014, that 9.3 percent of non- accelerated filers incorrectly report their icfr to be effective and that 38.1 percent of these, or 3.5 percent, would correctly report their icfr to be ineffective if subjected to the icfr auditor attestation requirement). \\\\523\\\\ id. we directly apply the results from the study and estimate that 3.5 percent of the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements may misreport that their icfr is effective, but would not misreport if subjected to those requirements. to be conservative, we do not adjust this estimate based on our conjecture that low-revenue issuers may be less likely than other issuers to fail to detect and disclose material weaknesses in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation, perhaps because they have less complex financial systems and controls. however, we note that the estimate may be somewhat inflated to the extent that this conjecture is correct. iii. effects on restatements we next consider the extent to which the possible effects on reported and unreported material weaknesses in icfr might translate into less reliable financial statements. by definition, material weaknesses represent a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the issuer's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis,\\\\524\\\\ and as discussed above, existing studies have demonstrated that ineffective icfr are associated with less reliable financial statements. thus, our estimated increase in the rate of ineffective icfr likely would translate into a decrease in the reliability of the financial statements of the affected issuers. however, low-revenue issuers could be less susceptible, on average, to at least certain kinds of misstatements. in particular, 10 to 20 percent of restatements and about 60 percent of the cases of financial disclosure fraud in recent times have been associated with improper revenue recognition,\\\\525\\\\ which is less of a risk, for example, for issuers that currently have no revenues. \\\\524\\\\ see regulation s-x rule 1-02(a)(4). \\\\525\\\\ see audit analytics, 2017 financial restatements: a seventeen year comparison, (may 2018), available at , and coso 2010 fraud study, note 505 above. we explored this possibility empirically in the proposing release, by comparing the percentage of issuers in different categories that eventually restated some of the financial statements that they reported for a given year, for the years 2014 through 2016. because we directly considered differences in actual restatements across these groups of issuers, these results should incorporate the effects of differences across the groups in both reported and unreported material weaknesses in icfr. our analysis demonstrated that issuers with revenues of less than $100 million have, on average, restatement rates that are three to nine percentage points lower than those for higher-revenue issuers of the same filer status.\\\\526\\\\ this result is consistent with low-revenue issuers being less likely to make restatements, even when they experience high rates of ineffective icfr, perhaps because they are less susceptible to certain kinds of misstatements (such as those related to revenue recognition). \\\\526\\\\ see section iii.c.4.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. as discussed in the proposing release, note 4 above, while observed restatements reflect misstatements that were detected and may only be a subset of actual misstatements, we believe that the lower restatement rates for low-revenue issuers are not driven by a difference in the ability to detect misstatements among these categories because we see this pattern for issuers with low rates of ineffective icfr as well as for other issuers. this result is also consistent with the bio study, which finds that biotechnology egcs have a two to three percentage point lower restatement rate than other non-accelerated or accelerated filers and attribute this to their ``absence of product revenue.'' see bio study, note 69 above (finding a 6.20 percent restatement rate for biotechnology egcs compared to rates of 7.98 percent and 9.25 percent for other non- accelerated and accelerated filers respectively). a number of commenters maintained that the risks of financial statement restatements or misstatements are greater for the issuers that would not be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement under the proposed amendments than for other issuers.\\\\527\\\\ a few of these commenters cited research that concludes that, since 2003, non- accelerated you.s. filers accounted for 62 percent of the total you.s. financial statement restatements.\\\\528\\\\ however, we note that this research is not specific to low-revenue issuers, unlike our analysis. as our analysis in the proposing release demonstrated, restatements are less frequent for low-revenue issuers even among non-accelerated filers. further, the cited research does not adjust for the high proportion of non-accelerated filers among all issuers. \\\\527\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, caq, ey, grant thornton, i am about to, prof. barth et al., and rsm. \\\\528\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq and cfa inst. other commenters noted that low-revenue issuers may be more susceptible to misstatements in revenue recognition \\\\529\\\\ or in areas other than revenue recognition,\\\\530\\\\ and that a higher risk of misstatements may be driven by characteristics of these issuers other than their low revenue, such as their lower resources or fewer personnel,\\\\531\\\\ complex transactions or arrangements,\\\\532\\\\ or activities that require significant accounting judgments.\\\\533\\\\ we note that our analysis is intended to capture all of these risks of restatements, by directly comparing rates of empirical restatements, and that we still find that the lower revenue issuers, taken in aggregate, are less likely to restate their financial statements than other issuers of the same filer status. thus, while certain subsets of the affected issuers may be more prone to restatements than others based on their specific characteristics, on average the affected issuers as a group appear to have a lower overall risk of restatement than higher-revenue issuers. \\\\529\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets and prof. barth et al. \\\\530\\\\ see, e.g., letter from bdo. \\\\531\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq, crowe, ey, and grant thornton. \\\\532\\\\ see, e.g., letter from bdo. \\\\533\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa inst. and bdo. however, in response to the comments, we further examine the argument that the affected issuers may be less susceptible to certain kinds of misstatements, such as those related to revenue recognition, by examining the types of restatements among low- and higher-revenue accelerated filers other than egcs in table 11.\\\\534\\\\ we note that the categorization of types and the names of these categories are based on the categories and category titles provided in the ives group audit analytics restatement database. \\\\534\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of data from ives group audit analytics. see note 298 above for details on the identification of filer type. the sample includes 2,017 issuer-year level observations that have low revenues and 3,862 issuer-year observations that have higher revenues. table 11percentage of all accelerated filers other than egcs with restatements of different types, by revenue category, for financial statements

under a particular category of restatement for a given year from 2014 through 2018. the table presents the results for the 15 most common restatement categories for low-revenue accelerated filers other than egcs. restatements can fall into more than one category, so the total of these percentages across all restatement categories would exceed the average rate of restatements. we also report the relative percentage of the restatement rate in a given category among the low-revenue issuers relative to the higher-revenue issuers. table 11 demonstrates that 1.3 percent of low-revenue accelerated filers other than egcs restated their financial statements for a given year from 2014 to 2018 due to revenue recognition issuers, representing about 40 percent of the rate of this type of restatement among higher- revenue accelerated filers other than egcs. similarly, for the next three most common categories of restatements for low-revenue accelerated filers other than egcs, the restatement rates of these issuers represented 42- to 60 percent of the corresponding rates among higher-revenue accelerated filers other than egcs. thus, this evidence supports our belief that the affected issuers may be less susceptible to certain kinds of misstatements, such as those related to revenue recognition. however, consistent with commenters concerns about other sources of misstatements, particularly with respect to complex contracts and arrangements, we find that the rate of restatements in some other categories is more similar across the two groups. for example, the rate of restatements related to ``debt, quasi-debt, warrants & equity (bcf) security issues'' and ``deferred, stock-based andor executive comp issues'' for the low-revenue issuers represent 115 percent and 85 percent respectively of the corresponding rates among the higher-revenue issuers. however, the rate of restatements is greater for the low- revenue issuers as compared to higher-revenue issuers only in the ``debt, quasi-debt, warrants & equity (bcf) security issues'' category, and only by a small margin: the restatement rates in this category are within 0.1 percentage points of each other, such that they are not statistically differentiable in our sample.\\\\535\\\\ \\\\535\\\\ there is also a slightly higher rate of restatements without a specified category among the low-revenue issuers, with 0.1 percent of their issuer-year level observations being associated with ``unspecified (amounts or accounts) restatement adjustments'' compared to 0.0 percent among the higher-revenue issuers. we therefore continue to believe that the evidence supports our hypothesis that the affected issuers are less likely to make restatements, perhaps because they are, on average, less susceptible to certain kinds of misstatements (such as those related to revenue recognition), than other accelerated filers. while this finding may mitigate the adverse effects on the reliability of financial statements for the affected issuers that will newly be exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements, we nonetheless expect some such effects. based on the analysis in the proposing release, and with consideration for the difference in size and maturity of the affected issuers versus the comparison sample, we estimated that the rate of restatements among the affected issuers may increase by two percentage points.\\\\536\\\\ given their lower current rates of restatement, even after such an increase the affected issuers may, on average, restate their financial statements at a rate that is lower than that of issuers that will remain accelerated filers, and that does not exceed that of non- accelerated filers and egcs with comparable revenues. \\\\536\\\\ see section iii.c.4.b. of the proposing release, note 4 above. several commenters indicated that we should have given consideration to the magnitude of restatements.\\\\537\\\\ in response to these comments, we have undertaken two types of analysis. first, we consider the potential effects on restatements that are deemed by issuers to be material. to do this, we begin by repeating our analysis for all types of restatements from the proposing release for the subset of item 4.02 restatements, which, as discussed above, are the restatements that issuers deem to be material and report in form 8-k item 4.02 disclosures, in table 12.\\\\538\\\\ \\\\537\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cfa inst., and prof. barth et al. \\\\538\\\\ the estimates in this table are based on staff analysis of ives group audit analytics data. percentages are computed out of all issuers of a given filer type and revenue category with revenue data and a sox section 404(a) management report available in the ives group audit analytics database. the accelerated and non-accelerated categories exclude egcs. see note 298 above for details on the identification of filer type. table 12percentage of issuers issuing item 4.02 restatements by year of restated financials, by revenue category non- restated year accelerated accelerated egc (ex. egcs) (ex. egcs) revenue <$100m: 2014 2.4 3.9 5.8 2015 3.5 3.1 4.2 2016

among low-revenue issuers, the accelerated filers other than egcs have a 0.2 percentage point (relative to non-accelerated filers other than egcs) or 1.5 percentage point (relative to egcs) lower rate of item 4.02 restatements than the issuers in the comparison populations, which are not subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. following our analysis in the proposing release, given the difference in size and maturity of the affected issuers versus the comparison samples, we look to the lower end of this range and, with rounding, estimate that the rate of item 4.02 restatements among the affected issuers may increase by 0.5 percentage points. given how low the rates of item 4.02 restatements are, the sample sizes in table 12 are not sufficient to reliably differentiate between these rates. we are nevertheless comfortable with this estimate because it is consistent with the estimate that would be obtained by applying the average rate of item 4.02 restatements out of all restatements, per table 9 above,\\\\539\\\\ to our estimate of the effect on total restatements. \\\\539\\\\ the ratio of item 4.02 restatements to all restatements in table 7 ranges from 15 percent for large accelerated filers other than egcs (1.6 percent divided by 10.6 percent) up to 35 percent for non-accelerated filers other than egcs (2.9 percent divided by 8.5 percent). applying these rates to our estimated 2 percentage point effect on total restatements would result in an estimate of a 0.3 to 0.7 percentage point effect on item 4.02 restatements. this estimate of the effects on restatements that issuers deem to be material may help to provide some perspective on the magnitude of the anticipated effect. we provide further analysis of these magnitudes by exploring the market and financial statement impacts of the estimated effect on restatements. table 15 in section iv.c.3.c below provides related estimates per item 4.02 restatement for low-revenue, seasoned issuers. in particular, the average net income impact for item 4.02 restatements is estimated to be -$1.9 million per year of restated financials for the 80 percent of cases where there is a net income impact, which is -$1.9 million times 80 percent or -$1.5 million on average across all cases. the average stock market impact is estimated to be -$1.4 million divided by 1.4 years or -$1 million per year of restated financials. we multiply these estimates by our estimate that an additional 0.5 percentage points of the affected issuers may have an item 4.02 restatement of their financial statements for a given year to obtain estimates of -$7,500 in net income impact or -$5,000 in stock market impact per year per affected issuer that will newly be exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements. one commenter provided alternative estimates of the magnitude of the effect on restatements, estimating that the affected issuers restated a total of $295 million in net income over the five years from 2014 through 2018 and that the 2018 restatements reduced market capitalizations by $294 million in aggregate.\\\\540\\\\ we do not rely on these estimates for two primary reasons. first, these estimates reflect restatements that have occurred while these issuers are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\541\\\\ they do not provide us with information about the magnitude of new restatements that would be experienced if this requirement were to be removed. the use of this estimate would reflect an assumption that restatements would increase by 100 percent upon removal of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, and we do not believe that there is evidence to support such an assumption. if anything, these estimates demonstrate the limitations of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, in that significant restatements still occur despite the requirement, rather than informing us of the risks of removing the requirement. \\\\540\\\\ see letter from prof. barth et al. see also letter from better markets, citing these estimates. \\\\541\\\\ similarly, one commenter cites charges of misconduct at a low-revenue issuer and argues that ``a well-designed icfr audit might have uncovered the control deficiencies, and related revenue recognition violations, more quickly.'' see letter from cfa. however, based on its edgar filings, the issuer was in fact subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement in fiscal year 2014, the beginning of the period of alleged misconduct (and may have been subject to the requirement in the remainder of the period of alleged misconduct as well, but did not file form 10-k in the following year), and the auditor's report in the associated form 10-k attested that the issuer's icfr was effective. secondly, these estimates reflect the years in which restatements were announced rather than when the actual misstatement occurred. effective icfr is intended to reduce the risk of material misstatements, so we believe it is important to focus on when misstatements occurred, not when earlier misstatements were detected and announced, which could actually be a sign of a careful audit and effective icfr. focusing on the year of the restatement announcement rather than the year of the misstatement could capture firms that may not have qualified as affected issuers during the time the misstatements were made, but only dropped into the category of affected issuers because of the reduction in public float or revenue that resulted from the major restatement and related issues.\\\\542\\\\ in contrast to the commenter's analysis, our analysis is designed to measure the rate and magnitude of the incremental restatements that can be attributed to misstatements in years in which the issuers would qualify under the amendments to be exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement and that would not have occurred if the issuers were subjected to this requirement. \\\\542\\\\ for example, a media report identified a particular issuer included in one commenter's analysis of significant restatements among issuers that were proposed to be exempted. see dave michaels, sec plan gives audit relief to firms that wiped out over $290 million, wall st. j., july 26, 2019. see also letter from prof. barth et al. (providing statistics but not identifying specific issuers). based on its edgar filings, the identified issuer had revenues substantially in excess of $100 million, even after the revisions described in the article, for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (the periods with misstatements that were later restated). further, this issuer was subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement as a large accelerated filer in 2015 and an accelerated filer in 2016. therefore, we do not believe the amendments, if effective during those fiscal years, would have exempted this issuer from the icfr auditor attestation requirement during the period in which the misstatements were made. iv. effects on fraudulent financial reporting several commenters indicated that we should give additional consideration to the potential impacts of the amendments on the risk of fraud.\\\\543\\\\ further, a number of commenters cautioned that the risks of fraudulent financial reporting may be particularly high for low-revenue issuers,\\\\544\\\\ perhaps because of their incentives to demonstrate strong growth \\\\545\\\\ or because of their high implied price-to-revenue multiples.\\\\546\\\\ as part of our consideration of these comments, we conducted certain supplemental analysis regarding the risk of fraudulent financial reporting. that analysis, discussed below, provides additional context for considering the possible effects of the amendments. we note that commenters did not provide their own analyses or suggest specific methodologies for estimating any potential impact of the amendments on the risk of fraud. \\\\543\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa inst., cii, and prof. barth et al. \\\\544\\\\ see, e.g., letter from cfa, cfa inst., cii and prof. barth et al. \\\\545\\\\ see, e.g., letter from cfa. \\\\546\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cii and prof. barth et al. we acknowledge that fraudulent misconduct does occur, including at low-revenue issuers, and that the incentives to engage in such misconduct could be heightened for certain low-revenue issuers, depending on their specific situation. it is less clear what the average risk of fraud is across low-revenue issuers in general, and how this overall risk may be affected by the icfr auditor attestation requirement. measuring these effects is challenging because the sample sizes associated with typical measures of fraud are small, making reliable statistical determinations difficult. further, we do not have an observable measure of all latent fraudulent conduct, but can only examine fraud that has been detected and that led to some observable action, which may not be a representative sample of all actual fraudulent activity. however, we acknowledge that it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of the amendments on the risk of fraud. we therefore use the available evidence and data to analyze this risk. we start by considering accounting and auditing enforcement releases (``aaers'') \\\\547\\\\ and cases of ``financial misconduct'' or ``financial reporting fraud'' based on subsets of these enforcement actions, as discussed below. a commenter noted that the proposing release did not consider the historical rate of fraud, the incidence of aaers, the incidence of wells notices and of formal sec investigations.\\\\548\\\\ while ``fraud'' may be defined in different ways, our analysis below considers the historical rate of fraud, based on analysis of a subset of aaers, and the incidence of aaers. we believe that these are more appropriate measures of potential fraud risk, as they reflect incidents in which the commission proceeded with charges. in contrast, formal investigations and wells notices do not always uncover, andor result in charges of, wrongdoing.\\\\549\\\\ the small sample size of aaers limits our ability to apply the methodology we used to estimate the potential impact on the prevalence of ineffective icfr and the rate of restatements \\\\550\\\\ to reliably estimate a potential effect on the incidence of aaers. instead, we begin by examining the representation of low-revenue as compared to higher-revenue issuers in the population of issuers with aaers or subsets of aaers that include certain types of charges, as compared to their representation in the broader population of issuers, in order to investigate commenters concerns that the affected issuers may face particularly high risks of fraudulent financial reporting. we then separately apply results from existing studies on fraudulent financial reporting to obtain an estimate of the potential impact of the amendments on such misconduct. \\\\547\\\\ aaers refer to certain financial reporting related enforcement actions concerning civil lawsuits brought by the commission in federal court and notices and orders concerning the institution andor settlement of administrative proceedings. links to these releases since 1999 are available at . \\\\548\\\\ see letter from prof. barth et al. \\\\549\\\\ see david solomon and eugene soltes, is ``not guilty'' the same as ``innocent''? evidence from sec financial fraud investigations, working paper (2019), available at (finding that, for financial fraud investigations by the commission between 2002 and 2005, only 25 percent resulted in enforcement actions); and jean eaglesham, sec drops 20% of probes after ``wells notice,'' wall st. j., october 9, 2013 (reporting that, for the two-year period that ended in september 2012, 20 percent of the wells notices issued were associated with investigations that were later closed without taking action being taken against the indicated parties). see also terrence blackburne, john kepler, phillip quinn and daniel taylor, undisclosed sec investigations, working paper (2019), available at (finding that, for commission investigations that were closed between 2000 and 2017, only 44 percent were eventually publicly disclosed, though the study does not identify the subset of these cases involving charges or any action being taken). \\\\550\\\\ see tables 13 and 14 of the proposing release, note 4 above, and the accompanying text. because the overall sample size of aaers is limited, we use the full sample of years for which data is available, such that the alleged misconduct we analyze ranges from fiscal year 1971 to 2016 (based on aaers issued from 1982 through 2018). we focus on issuers that are not within five years of their ipo (``seasoned issuers'') to better represent the affected issuers. revenues are measured as of the date of the first misstated financial statements associated with an aaer, rather than at the date of the enforcement action, which is generally many years after this date.\\\\551\\\\ \\\\551\\\\ the estimates in table 13 are based on staff analysis of the you.s.c. marshall aaer database, which contains information on aaers issued between may 1982 and december 2018, supplemented with information from aaers (for a smaller sample, as discussed below) and data from compustat. multiple aaers associated with the same financial statement years are treated as a single case. consecutive years of financial statements associated with aaers are also treated as a single case. table 13representation of low-revenue and higher-revenue seasoned issuers in the population and among those with aaers among issuers not within 5 years of ipo percent with percent with revenue revenue <$100m >=$100m total issuer-year level observations 50 50 with revenue data issuers with aaers: with alleged ``financial 42 58 misstatements'' and with ``financial misconduct'' 24 76 charges and with ``financial reporting 30 70 fraud'' charges the years after an issuer's ipo are computed as of the first date of the financial statements associated with the aaers.this row includes data for fiscal years from 1971 through 2016 to reflect the full horizon of years of alleged misconduct identified in the you.s.c. marshall aaer database. as noted below, data on ``financial misconduct'' charges and ``financial reporting fraud'' charges was only collected for aaers issued from 2002 through 2018. while these charges represent alleged misconduct dating back to as early as 1985, they are more likely to reflect relatively more recent years than those reflected in the full sample of aaers. we therefore note, for the purpose of consideration of the last two rows of table 13, that the percentage of low-revenue issuers among the total issuer-year observations of seasoned issuers with revenue data is reduced somewhat in the more recent part of this sample, to about 47 percent when considering data from fiscal years 1985 through 2016 or about 42 percent when considering data from fiscal years 2000 through 2016.this row represents aaers that the you.s.c. marshall aaer database indicates as being associated with alleged financial misstatements.this row represents aaers among those included in the previous row that also include charges under section 13(b)(2)(a) (requiring issuers to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer), section 13(b)(2)(b) (requiring an issuer to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide certain reasonable assurances), or section 13(b)(5) (requiring that no person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify any book, record, or account) of the securities exchange act, or rules 13b2-1 (requiring that no person directly or indirectly, falsify or because to be falsified, any book, record or account) or 13b2-2 (requiring certain representations and conduct by directors and officers in connection with the preparation of required reports and documents) under the securities exchange act. we only supplemented the you.s.c. marshall aaer database with information about these specific charges where applicable for aaers issued from 2002 through 2018 (which include alleged misconduct associated with financial statements from fiscal year 1985 through 2016), so the set of aaers considered in the computations in this row reflect a substantially smaller population of aaers than those included in the second row of this table, which includes earlier aaers (issued beginning in 1982). our estimates do not significantly change if we remove charges associated only with third parties rather than the issuer in question andor its staff from the sample before running the analysis.this row represents aaers among those included in the previous row that also include charges under the anti-fraud statutes in section 17(a)(1) of the securities act or section 10(b) of the securities exchange act. see also noteabove regarding limitations on the population of aaers for which we supplemented the you.s.c. marshall aaer database with information on these charges. our estimates do not significantly change if we remove charges associated only with third parties rather than the issuer in question andor its staff from the sample before running the analysis. in table 13, we consider all aaers with alleged financial misstatements (row 2), as well as two subsets of these aaers that we identify for those issued in, roughly, the past two decades.\\\\552\\\\ the first subset (row 3) represents those that we can identify as including charges under section 13(b)(2)(a), section 13(b)(2)(b), or section 13(b)(5) of the securities exchange act, or rules 13b2-1 or 13b2-2 under the securities exchange act. these cases have been identified by researchers as representing ``financial misconduct.'' \\\\553\\\\ the second subset (row 4) is the subset of the ``financial misconduct'' cases that we can identify as also including charges under section 17(a)(1) of the securities act or section 10(b) of the securities exchange act, which is one common way of identifying cases of ``financial reporting fraud.'' \\\\554\\\\ we note that others may define ``financial misconduct'' and ``financial reporting fraud'' differently.\\\\555\\\\ \\\\552\\\\ the population of aaers considered in these subsets is limited to those issued from 2002 through 2018. see table 13 above. \\\\553\\\\ see jonathan karpoff, allison koester, d. scott lee, and gerald martin, proxies and databases in financial misconduct research, 92(6) account. rev. 129 (2017) (``karpoff et al. 2017 study''). this study also raised concerns about omissions in the you.s.c. marshall aaer database, which they refer to as the cfrm database, but they noted that they understood that this issue was being addressed and that users of the newer iterations of this dataset, after the date of the study, should face lower or zero rates of effective omissions. \\\\554\\\\ see, e.g., karpoff et al. 2017 study, note 553 above, and coso 2010 fraud study, note 505 above. \\\\555\\\\ see, e.g., karpoff et al. 2017 study, note 553 above, (describing certain other measures researchers have used and their limitations), note 553 above. per the second through fourth rows of table 13, the representation of low-revenue seasoned issuers among all seasoned issuers with any of these types of aaers ranges from 24 to 42 percent. for comparison, we also derive the representation of low-revenue seasoned issuers among all seasoned issuers in the population. per the first row of table 13, across all of the years of our sample, and specifically among the seasoned issuers, 50 percent of the issuer-year observations are associated with low revenues.\\\\556\\\\ thus, we do not find evidence based on the available data that low-revenue issuers are more highly represented in the set of seasoned issuers associated with ``financial misconduct'' or ``financial reporting fraud'' than they are in the overall population of seasoned issuers. \\\\556\\\\ while the latter two rows of table 13, regarding ``financial misconduct'' and ``financial reporting fraud,'' are based on relatively more recent data (aaers issued from 2002 through 2018, reflecting alleged misconduct from 1985 to 2016), we note that considering the prevalence of low-revenue issuers in relatively more recent years does not change our conclusions. for example, the percentage of low-revenue issuers among the total issuer-year observations of seasoned issuers with revenue data is about 47 percent when considering data from 1985 through 2016 (reaching a minimum of 38 percent in 2016), which still exceeds the 25 to 30 percent of the seasoned issuers associated with ``financial misconduct'' or ``financial reporting fraud'' that have low revenues. a caveat to this finding is that it only reflects cases of discovered and charged alleged misconduct, and may not be representative of all cases of actual misconduct.\\\\557\\\\ also, this analysis is limited to the population of aaers. there may be additional cases of alleged misconduct with respect to financial reporting that are charged but not associated with aaers, and low-revenue issuers could be more highly represented among these cases.\\\\558\\\\ further, even if the affected issuers may not be more likely to engage in fraudulent financial reporting than other seasoned issuers on average, certain of these affected issuers may have heightened incentives to engage in such activities, as noted by the commenters cited above. \\\\557\\\\ we note that the required data, such as data on revenues, may be less likely to be available for low-revenue issuers to the extent that, like other small issuers, they are less likely to be covered by traditional databases. this could reduce our ability to detect a higher representation of these issuers among those with various types of aaers. however, this should generally be accounted for in our analysis because we draw comparisons only within the population of issuers with available data, and the same limitation applies to our ability to estimate the representation of such issuers in the overall population as in the population with aaers. \\\\558\\\\ for example, not all of the enforcement actions listed in the category of ``issuer reportingauditing & accounting'' in the annual report of the commission's division of enforcement are associated with aaers. see, e.g., 2019 annual report, division of enforcement, available at . we next consider whether expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement for such issuers would affect their likelihood of engaging in such activities. to address this question, we rely on a study that associates material weaknesses in icfr with an increased rate of ``financial reporting fraud.'' \\\\559\\\\ in particular, the study associates reporting ``entity-level'' material weaknesses in icfr,\\\\560\\\\ but not other types of material weaknesses, with a 1.22 percentage point increase in the rate of ``financial reporting fraud'' over the following three years, or 0.41 percentage points (1.22 divided by three) per year. \\\\559\\\\ see donelson et al. 2017 study, note 470 above. this study identifies ``financial reporting fraud'' as either (1) the sample of ``fraud'' cases in the ``financial misrepresentation dataset'' from that underlies the karpoff et al. 2017 study, note 553 above, which, based on the latter study, represents the subset of commission or department of justice enforcement actions that include charges under sections 13(b)(2)(a), section 13(b)(2)(b), or section 13(b)(5) of the securities exchange act, or rules 13b2-1 or 13b2-2 under the securities exchange act, that also include charges under the anti-fraud statutes in section 17(a)(1) of the securities act or section 10(b) of the securities exchange act; or (2) settled securities class-action lawsuits that allege violations of gaap. \\\\560\\\\ this study defines entity-level material weaknesses as those that ives group audit analytics identifies as being in any of the following categories: (1) non-routine transaction control issues; (2) journal entry control issues; (3) foreign, related- party, affiliated, or subsidiary issues; (4) an ineffective, nonexistent, or understaffed audit committee; (5) senior management competency, tone, or reliability issues; (6) an insufficient or nonexistent internal audit function; (7) ethical or compliance issues with personnel; or (8) accounting personnel resources, competency, or training issues. see donelson et al. 2017 study, note 470 above. given that any impact of the icfr auditor attestation requirement on the risk of fraud is likely to result from the effect of this requirement on the effectiveness of icfr, we apply the results of this study to our estimated effect on icfr to quantify the potential increase in this risk that could be associated with the amendments. per the results earlier in this section, we estimate that the amendments may eventually result in an additional 15 percentage points of the affected issuers maintaining ineffective icfr. examining the types of material weaknesses experienced by low-revenue issuers of different filer statuses, we find that up to 85 percent of their material weaknesses would be classified as ``entity-level'' material weaknesses as defined by the study we are relying on.\\\\561\\\\ applying the above annualized estimate of a 0.41 percentage point increase in the rate of financial reporting fraud for issuers reporting ``entity-level'' material weaknesses to our estimate of a 12.75 percentage point (15 percentage points times 85 percent) increase in the prevalence of such material weaknesses, we estimate that the amendments could eventually lead to an additional 0.05 percentage points (0.41 percent times 12.75 percentage points) of the affected issuers being associated with alleged ``financial reporting fraud'' with respect to their financial statements for a given year. \\\\561\\\\ see note 560 above. to better understand the magnitude of this potential effect, we rely on another study that estimates that issuers lose a total of 38 percent of their equity market value upon announcements of ``financial misrepresentation,'' or, given that the alleged violation periods in their sample span 27 months on average, 17 percent of equity market capitalization for each affected year.\\\\562\\\\ the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements have an average equity market capitalization of about $205 million. we therefore estimate that the magnitude of the potential increase in fraud risk is 0.05 percentage points (our estimated annualized rate of the increase in issuer-years associated with ``financial reporting fraud'') times 17 percent times $205 million, or about $17,500 in market capitalization per year per affected issuer that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirements. we view this estimate as conservative because the study we rely on includes issuers that are younger and significantly smaller than the affected issuers, and we believe that the percentage of market capitalization loss is likely to be greater for such firms. \\\\562\\\\ see jonathan karpoff, d. scott lee, and gerald martin, the cost to firms of cooking the books, 48(3) j. of fin. and quantitative analysis 581 (2008) (``karpoff et al. 2008 study''). the study defines ``financial misrepresentation'' consistently with the ``financial misrepresentation dataset'' from which, based on the karpoff et al. 2017 study, note 553 above, represents the subset of commission or department of justice enforcement actions that include charges under sections 13(b)(2)(a), section 13(b)(2)(b), or section 13(b)(5) of the securities exchange act, or rules 13b2-1 or 13b2-2 under the securities exchange act. while the ``financial misrepresentation'' sample does not also require charges under the anti-fraud statutes, the karpoff et al. 2008 study indicates that over three-fourths of this sample was associated with fraud charges. overall, this analysis does not because us to change our primary conclusions regarding the potential effects of the amendments. v. timing of the effects we anticipate that the potential adverse effects of the amendments will develop gradually and are likely to be relatively limited in the short term. we discuss the reasons that we expect a gradual evolution in the remainder of this section. nevertheless, we recognize that a delay in realizing some of the associated costs from the amendments would not necessarily mitigate their ultimate effects. the preceding discussion is based on the comparison of steady-state differences across issuers in different categories, and represents an analysis of the eventual effects of the amendments. because the amendments will allow some current accelerated filers to transition to non-accelerated filer status, some issuers that have already been subject to an audit of icfr for one or more years may no longer be required to obtain an icfr auditor attestation. while other issuers will enter into the affected issuers category without having previously obtained an icfr auditor attestation, and such issuers are likely to represent a larger fraction of the affected issuers over time, initially issuers with experience with icfr auditor attestations are expected to represent a substantial fraction of the affected issuers. newly exempt issuers may have implemented control improvements that would persist regardless of a transition. for example, they may have made investments in systems, procedures, or training that are unlikely to be reversed. it is difficult to predict the degree of inertia in icfr and financial reporting in order to gauge how quickly, if at all, issuers that cease audits of icfr may evolve such that their icfr and the reliability of their financial statements is more characteristic of exempt issuers.\\\\563\\\\ the gradual nature of such an evolution, and the associated halo effect of the last disclosed icfr auditor attestation, may limit the short-term costs of the amendments. in addition, issuers that believe control improvements are valuable for reporting and certifying results will be free to spend the resources saved on the attestations on such improvements. \\\\563\\\\ we note that there is a relatively small sample of accelerated filers transitioning to non-accelerated filer status because of changes in their public float, as compared to transitions in the other direction, and that such transitions likely represent special circumstances such as underperformance. therefore, such transitions are not particularly helpful for predicting the outcomes of accelerated filers transitioning to non-accelerated filer status because of the amendments. affected issuers with experience with audits of icfr may also be more likely to continue to obtain an icfr auditor attestation on a voluntary basis than other exempt issuers are to begin voluntary audits of icfr. this may be due to such issuers having already incurred certain start-up costs or facing demand from their current investors to continue to provide icfr auditor attestations. some issuers in the groups that we use for comparison, which are not subject to an icfr auditor attestation requirement, voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation. thus, the comparisons made above at least partially account for the fact that some issuers may choose to obtain an icfr auditor attestation even in the absence of a requirement. however, to the extent the rate of voluntary icfr auditor attestations would be higher amongst the issuers that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement than other exempt issuers, the anticipated costs of the amendments in the near term may be further reduced. c. implications for investor decision-making while we anticipate that the frequency of ineffective icfr and, to a lesser extent, restatements may increase among the affected issuers as a result of the amendments, the economic effects of these changes may be reduced by another factor that may apply to many of these issuers. in particular, the usefulness of more reliable financial statements is linked to the degree to which they factor into the decisions of investors,\\\\564\\\\ for example, with respect to these investors' valuations of issuers.\\\\565\\\\ the financial statements of many low-revenue issuers may have relatively lower relevance for market performance if, for example, relative to higher-revenue issuers, their valuation hinges more on their future prospects than on their current financial performance. \\\\564\\\\ see, e.g., dechow and schrand 2004 monograph, note 506 above. \\\\565\\\\ see, e.g., jennifer francis & katherine schipper, have financial statements lost their relevance?, 37(2) j. of account. res. 319 (1999) (``francis and schipper 1999 study''); and s. p. kothari, capital markets research in accounting, 31 j. of account. and econ. 105 (2001). we explored this possibility empirically in the proposing release, which used the methodology applied in previous studies to calculate, for issuers above and below the $100 million revenue threshold, the extent to which the variation in market performance is related to the variation in financial measures. for issuers at or above $100 million in revenue, we found, consistent with the findings of previous studies of all issuers, that key financial variables (the book value of assets and liabilities, the book value of equity, earnings, and the change in earnings) explain about 60 to 70 percent of the variation in equity market capitalization and 7.5 percent of the variation in stock returns.\\\\566\\\\ in contrast, for issuers with revenues of less than $100 million, we found that these financial variables explain about 30 percent of the variation in equity market capitalization and just over 4.5 percent of the variation in stock returns. \\\\566\\\\ see table 15 of the proposing release, note 4 above. see also francis and schipper 1999 study note 565 above. while that study ends in 1994, before our 20 year horizon, the results are similar. for example, for the most recent ten years in that study, the book values of assets and liabilities explain 54 to 70 percent of the variation in equity market valuation, the book value of equity and earnings explain 63 to 78 percent of the variation in equity market valuation, and earnings and the change in earnings explain six to 20 percent of the variation in stock returns. one commenter indicated that a low-revenue issuer could have a large market capitalization and thus ``greater investor exposure.'' \\\\567\\\\ while we agree that such affected issuers would generally expose more investors to risk, we note that the results discussed above suggest that, on average, relative to higher-revenue issuers, less of this risk seems to be associated with the issuers' current financial statements than with their future prospects.\\\\568\\\\ another commenter agreed that future prospects are important to the valuation of entities in a growth phase, but noted that the financial variables we consider in our analysis are more likely to be considered in the valuation of low-revenue issuers that are more seasoned, and that we should therefore more fully consider the implications for these issuers in particular.\\\\569\\\\ this commenter also suggested that we might consider additional financial variables that may be more relevant to the valuation of low-revenue issuers, such as the rate of revenue growth and measures of liquidity. in response to this comment, we conducted supplemental analysis of the empirical relevance of financial statements for low-revenue issuers in table 14.\\\\570\\\\ specifically, because the affected issuers that will newly be exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement are generally not within five years of their ipo, we limit the analysis to more seasoned issuers. further, we run the analysis with additional variables, as discussed below. \\\\567\\\\ see letter from grant thornton. \\\\568\\\\ also, the affected parties are limited to issuers with no more than $700 million in public float. further, as discussed in section iv.c.3.d. below, we estimate that in aggregate the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements represent 0.2 percent of the total equity market capitalization of issuers. \\\\569\\\\ see letter from crane. \\\\570\\\\ the reported statistics are adjusted r-squared statistics based on regression analysis by staff using data from the standard & poor's compustat and center for research in security prices databases. seasoned issuers are those for which the data date is not within five years of the reported ipo date, where ipo dates are available. market value and financial variables are measured as of the end of the fiscal year. earnings is income before extraordinary items. stock return is the 15-month stock return ending three months after fiscal year-end, to account for reporting lags. for the stock return regression, the explanatory variables are scaled by the lagged market value of equity, and outliers in one percent tails of variable distributions are dropped to reduce noise. see francis and schipper 1999 study, note 565 above, for additional details. table 14percentage of variation in market performance

revenue, change in revenue, r&d expense, change in r&d expense. the first three rows of table 14 are similar to the analysis in the proposing release, but are limited to issuers that are not within five years of their ipo. focusing on this subsample of low-revenue issuers, which is more representative of the affected issuers that would be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement, we find that the financial variables considered in the proposing release explain about 40 to 45 percent of the variation in equity market capitalization and about 5.5 percent of the variation in stock returns. these percentages are slightly higher than our results for all low- revenue issuers in the proposing release (for which the variables explain about 30 percent and 4.5 percent of the variation in equity market capitalization and stock returns respectively, as noted above). however, they remain substantially lower than the results for higher- revenue seasoned issuers, for which the variables explain about 60 to 70 percent of the variation in equity market capitalization and about 7.5 percent of the variation in stock returns. the second panel of table 14 considers additional variables based on the comment letter discussed above and on academic accounting literature on key value-relevant metrics. for example, the role of the book value of equity in valuation may reflect, among other things, the liquidation or adaptation value of an issuer.\\\\571\\\\ however, a commenter noted that, for issuers with little to no revenue, liquidity metrics are often relevant to a user's evaluation of future prospects.\\\\572\\\\ we agree that there is evidence that, for certain issuers, liquidity metrics that relate current assets to current liabilities may provide key additional information on the likelihood of, and value upon, liquidation.\\\\573\\\\ we therefore include the quick ratio (current assets less inventories, which may be difficult to monetize in the short term, minus current liabilities) in the analysis as a supplement to the book value of equity. \\\\571\\\\ see, e.g., philip berger, eli ofek, and itzahk swary, investor valuation of the abandonment option, 42(2) j. of fin. econ. 259 (1996); david burgstahler and ilia dichev, earnings, adaptation and equity value, 72(2) account. rev. 187 (1997). \\\\572\\\\ see letter from crowe. \\\\573\\\\ see, e.g., sergei davydenko, when do firms default? a study of the default boundary, working paper (2012), available at (finding that the quick ratio is highly correlated with the short-term probability of default, particularly for firms with less access to external capital). in considering further variables that would be appropriate to include in this analysis, we note that low-revenue issuers are significantly more likely to be loss-making than higher-revenue issuers.\\\\574\\\\ the academic literature provides evidence that for loss firms, revenues (and the change in revenues, or revenue growth) can be more value-relevant than earnings (and the change in earnings).\\\\575\\\\ a commenter also identified the rate of revenue growth as an example of a financial statement variable that investors may consider for low- revenue firms.\\\\576\\\\ separately, we note that research and development (``r&d'') costs are expensed and thereby reduce earnings, while there is evidence that the future benefits of r&d activity may not be reflected in the earnings of loss-making firms.\\\\577\\\\ for these reasons, we include revenues and r&d expenses (and the change in these measures) as a supplement to earnings (and the change in earnings) in the analysis in the second panel of table 14. \\\\574\\\\ in this analysis, about half of the low-revenue issuers are loss-making, compared to about ten percent of the higher-revenue issuers. \\\\575\\\\ see, e.g., aswath damodaran, the dark side of valuation: firms with no earnings, no history and no comparables, working paper (1999), available at . \\\\576\\\\ see letter from crowe. \\\\577\\\\ see, e.g., laurel franzen and suresh radhakrisnan, the value relevance of r&d across profit and loss firms, 28 (1) j. of account. and pub. pol'y 16 (2009). as demonstrated in the last two rows of table 14, including these additional variables does increase the amount of variation in equity market capitalization and stock returns explained by the financial statement variables. however, the percentage of explained variation remains lower for low-revenue seasoned issuers than for higher-revenue seasoned issuers. these results demonstrate that financial statement information is not irrelevant for low-revenue issuers. that is, information from financial statements is associated with market prices and returns for these issuers as well as other issuers. thus, the potential reduction in the reliability of financial statements for the affected issuers is expected to have some negative implications. however, the lower empirical relevance of financial statements on average for these issuers may partially mitigate the potential adverse effects of the amendments. in contrast to these findings, a number of commenters cited analysis in commissioner jackson's statement suggesting that, based on the stock market reaction to annual report filings disclosing material weaknesses in icfr, investors care most about the information provided by the icfr auditor attestation of low-revenue issuers.\\\\578\\\\ further, one of these commenters stated that the markets impose a ``much heftier penalty'' on small companies that restate than they do on larger companies.\\\\579\\\\ on the other hand, other commenters expressed the view that the icfr auditor attestation requirement is not important or material to the investors of affected issuers, based on their own experience andor a study referencing an analysis of the market reaction to section 302 internal control weakness disclosures.\\\\580\\\\ as further evidence, two of these commenters asserted that investors rarely ask an issuer that is exempt from obtaining an icfr auditor attestation to voluntarily comply with the requirement.\\\\581\\\\ in response to these comments, we have conducted analyses of the investor response to icfr disclosures and restatement announcements at low- revenue issuers versus other issuers. \\\\578\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cfa, cfa inst., and cii, citing the event study analysis in commissioner jackson's statement. \\\\579\\\\ see letter from cfa. \\\\580\\\\ see, e.g., letters from adamas, ardelyx, asa, bio, carver, catalyst, chiasma, corvus, cymabay, equillium, evoke, gritstone, kezar, marinus, millendo, organovo, pieris, revance, si-bone, syros, teligent, and zynerba. many of these letters cited the bio study, note 69 above, which in turn cites jacqueline hammersley, linda myers, and catherina shakespeare, market reactions to the disclosure of internal control weaknesses and to the characteristics of those weaknesses under section 302 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002, 13(1) rev. of account. stud. 141 (2008) (``hammersley et al. 2008 study''). the bio letter also directly cites the latter study. the bio study and bio letter highlight the finding of the hammersley et al. 2008 study that the market response to issuers disclosing material weaknesses in disclosure controls in their section 302 disclosures is, in the whole sample, not statistically different from zero. however, we note that this study does find evidence of a statistically significant negative market reaction to such disclosures in a subsample uncontaminated by other announcements in the event window. \\\\581\\\\ see letters from ardelyx and bio. first, we consider the market reaction to the filing of annual reports that contain icfr auditor attestations reporting material weaknesses in icfr. we only consider icfr auditor attestation reports, as opposed to section 404(a) management reports, in order to focus on a sample of issuers comparable to the affected issuers \\\\582\\\\ and those reports that would no longer be required under the amendments. because material weaknesses may persist across years, consecutive disclosures that continue to report material weaknesses are not likely to represent news to the market. we therefore focus on material weakness disclosures that are preceded by an icfr auditor attestation reporting effective icfr. we consider issuers with revenues of less than $100 million and higher-revenue issuers, but exclude those within five years of their ipo to more closely represent the affected issuers.\\\\583\\\\ figure 7 \\\\584\\\\ presents the results of our event study analysis for disclosures in the last decade.\\\\585\\\\ \\\\582\\\\ in particular, section 404(a) management reports are required of all issuers other than rics and abs issuers, including those that are already non-accelerated filers and would therefore not be affected by the amendments. \\\\583\\\\ we obtain substantially similar results if we consider all issuers, rather than excluding those within five years of their ipo, or if we include consecutive annual reports with material weakness disclosures, rather than focusing on new material weakness disclosures. \\\\584\\\\ this figure is based on results from the event study by wrds module available through wharton research data services and staff analysis of data from ives group audit analytics, compustat, and crsp. the figure includes all seasoned issuers that have an auditor attestation of icfr that newly reports material weaknesses in icfr following a previous attestation to effective icfr in annual reports filed in calendar years 2009 through 2018. we exclude issuers for which the data date is within five years of the ipo date (i.e., non-seasoned issuers), if available. the cumulative average abnormal returns are calculated with respect to expected returns based on a multi-factor model including the three fama french factors and a momentum factor, where the model parameters are calculated over an estimation period of up to 100 trading days ending 50 trading days before the event period. \\\\585\\\\ this time horizon was chosen to maximize the sample size while limiting the study to the period after the effectiveness of as no. 5 (now referred to as as 2201, note 292 above), which may have changed the nature of icfr auditor attestations. see section iv.b.1. above for a discussion of this auditing standard and the evidence that the nature of icfr auditor attestations may have changed as a result of its adoption. our results are substantially similar when considering alternative time horizons, such as the past five years. [graphic] [tiff omitted] tr26mr20.006 our analysis does not suggest that investors care more about the information produced by the icfr auditor attestation requirement at low-revenue issuers. in particular, investors did not react more negatively to low-revenue issuers disclosing material weaknesses than to such disclosures by the higher-revenue issuers. none of the cumulative average abnormal returns plotted in the figure, whether for low- or higher-revenue issuers, are statistically differentiable from zero at conventional confidence levels.\\\\586\\\\ \\\\586\\\\ the analysis applies the standardized cross-sectional test, which is robust to cross-sectional dependence in abnormal returns (which often results when events cluster in time, as in the case of annual report filing dates) as well as any event-induced increase in the variance of returns, to measure the statistical significance of the abnormal returns. see ekkehart boehmer, jim musumeci, and annette poulsen, event-study methodology under conditions of event-induced variance, 30(2) j. of fin. econ. 253 (1991) (``boehmer et al. 1991''). our figure differs from the similar analysis that was cited by commenters for a number of reasons. first, that analysis includes a number of duplicate observations.\\\\587\\\\ the duplication generally occurs when there is both an icfr auditor attestation and a section 404(a) management report reporting a material weakness in the same annual report. while the duplicate observations appear to have only a modest effect on the pattern of the measured cumulative abnormal returns, they likely have the effect of biasing downward the width of the confidence interval presented in the analysis. when we remove the duplicates, we find that, as in our own analysis, the cumulative average abnormal returns for low-revenue issuers are not statistically differentiable from zero at conventional confidence levels for any day within the 11- day event period surrounding the disclosure date.\\\\588\\\\ also, we note that even without this adjustment, the confidence intervals plotted in the other analysis indicate that, by the end of the presented event period, the cumulative average abnormal returns are no longer statistically differentiable from zero for issuers with below $100 million in revenues.\\\\589\\\\ \\\\587\\\\ about 30% of the low-revenue observations in the analysis are exact duplicates in terms of company identifiers, event date, revenue and returns. see ``abnormal returns data,'' available at . \\\\588\\\\ the width of the confidence interval at the far right side of the figure (for day +5) in the analysis cited by commenters appears to be about 0.85 percentage points. we understand that the standard errors in that analysis are simple cross-sectional standard errors (which are robust to event-induced increases in the variance of returns but not to any cross-sectional dependence in abnormal returns). removing the duplicates, we find that the width of the corresponding 95% confidence interval would be 2.02 percentage points using this approach, which is about 2.4 times wider than the reported confidence interval. \\\\589\\\\ in particular, the presented confidence bands for the cumulative abnormal returns include zero by day 11 of the analysis, which considers the 11-day period beginning five days prior and ending five days subsequent to the date of disclosure. second, more than half of the non-duplicate low-revenue observations in the other analysis appear to reflect reports of material weaknesses in section 404(a) management reports in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation. as discussed above, our analysis excludes observations where there is only a section 404(a) management report because we believe they have limited relevance when considering the affected issuers and the effects of the amendments. third, the other analysis reflects a different time horizon (2004 through 2017) than our analysis (2009 through 2018). in our analysis, we restrict the time horizon to the period after the effectiveness of as no. 5 because the nature of icfr auditor attestations may have changed after this point. these additional differences in the underlying sample appear to drive the differences in the pattern of the cumulative average abnormal returns in the analysis cited by commenters relative to our own analysis.\\\\590\\\\ however, even if we were to use the broader set of reports andor the time horizon of the other analysis, we continue to find that the cumulative average abnormal returns are not statistically differentiable from zero at conventional confidence levels for any day within the 11-day event period surrounding the disclosure date. \\\\590\\\\ while, as discussed above, we also refine the analysis presented in figure 7 to exclude consecutive disclosures that continue to report material weaknesses and to limit the analysis to seasoned issuers, we find that these choices have more modest effects on the pattern of cumulative average abnormal returns. there is substantial noise inherent to an analysis of the disclosure of material weaknesses in annual reports, both because these reports often contain or are accompanied by significant confounding information \\\\591\\\\ and because material weaknesses are often disclosed in advance of the annual report.\\\\592\\\\ we therefore also undertook analysis of the market and financial statement impact of material restatements disclosed in item 4.02 form 8-k filings, which are relatively less likely to be accompanied by unrelated news or to be disclosed in advance of the filing. we consider restatements over the 10-year horizon from 2009 through 2018 to obtain more reliable estimates while still focusing on a recent period that should be reasonably representative of the current environment.\\\\593\\\\ \\\\591\\\\ staff analysis of material weakness disclosures that were accompanied by large positive or negative stock returns found evidence of announcements of confounding news that are associated with large positive returns (e.g., significantly beat earnings estimates, positive news about phase iii trial, liquidity infusion, merger announcement) and large negative returns (e.g., significantly miss earnings estimates, liquidity problems and security issuance at significant discount). see also, e.g., paul griffin, got information? investor response to form 10-k and form 10-q edgar filings, 8(4) rev. of account. stud. 433 (2003) (for more detail on the overall information content of annual reports) and edward li and k. ramesh, market reaction surrounding the filing of periodic sec reports, 84(4) account. rev 1171 (2009) (for further analysis of the information content released in, and at the time of, annual report filing). \\\\592\\\\ staff analysis of material weakness disclosures that were preceded by an icfr auditor attestation reporting effective icfr found that in about one-third of cases these new material weaknesses had been disclosed prior to the annual report, such as in an item 4.02 form 8-k or a form 10-q filing. \\\\593\\\\ the estimates in table 15 are based on staff analysis of restatements associated with an item 4.02 8-k dated within calendar years 2009 through 2018. the sample includes, for issuers that are not within five years of their ipo, 260 restatements by low-revenue issuers and 384 restatements for higher-revenue issuers with non- missing stock returns. the data on restatements, including their financial statement effects, are from audit analytics. revenues are measured as of the beginning of the restated period. the data on revenues and ipo dates are from compustat. the announcement returns are cumulative abnormal returns based on results from the event study by wrds module available through wharton research data services. they represent the cumulative abnormal returns for the two-day event period including the date of the associated 8-k filing and the following trading day. these abnormal returns are estimated relative to a benchmark model of returns based on the three fama- french factors and a momentum factor, where the model parameters are calculated over an estimation period of up to 100 trading days ending 50 trading days before the event date. the confidence intervals are based on the standardized cross-sectional test of boehmer et al. 1991, note 586 above. table 15estimated effects of item 4.02 8-k restatements announced by seasoned issuers in 2009-2018, by revenue category at time of the

period 1.4 years 2.0 years. this row, based on the ``effect'' variable from ives group audit analytics, indicates whether the net effect to the financial statements (income statement, balance sheet or cash flows) was negative. as with our previous analyses, this supplemental analysis also does not support the assertion that investors care more about the reliability of the information in the financial statements of low- revenue issuers than that of higher-revenue issuers. the market reaction to item 4.02 form 8-k filings is statistically indistinguishable from zero for low-revenue, seasoned issuers, but is negative and statistically significant for higher-revenue issuers. while the point estimates for the market impact of the restatements are uncertain, as demonstrated by the confidence intervals presented in the second row of table 15, the corresponding point estimates for the dollar market impact per restatement announcement are also substantially lower (at $1.4 million versus $22.0 million) for low- revenue seasoned issuers as compared to higher-revenue seasoned issuers. the rate of item 4.02 restatements with negative financial statement impact or with net income impact is similar for both categories of issuers, at about 80 percent. we also consider how the average dollar market impact of the restatements relates to the average dollar correction in annualized net income, in case investors react more strongly per dollar of the correction in annualized net income for low-revenue issuers. however, table 15 does not provide evidence that the corresponding point estimate dollar market impact is proportionately greater relative to the average annualized effect on net income for low-revenue seasoned issuers than for high revenue seasoned issuers.\\\\594\\\\ \\\\594\\\\ in particular, the ratio of average dollar market impact of the restatements relative to the average dollar correction in annualized net income for low-revenue seasoned issuers is -$1.4m- $1.9m or about 0.7, while the corresponding ratio for higher-revenue seasoned issuers is -$22.0-$13.2 or about 1.7. overall, we acknowledge that a lower reliability of their financial statements may have significant effects on the valuation of certain low-revenue issuers. it is possible, for example, as one commenter stated, that ``[for] many low-revenue companies that are struggling to become high revenue companies . . . their ability to attract capital may depend primarily on their ability to convince analysts and investors that their revenues are strong and steadily rising.'' \\\\595\\\\ however, when we consider the evidence in aggregate across the population of low-revenue and higher-revenue seasoned issuers based on the three different types of analyses in this section, we find some evidence that financial statements and their reliability are less associated with market prices for low-revenue issuers and no evidence that there is a stronger association with market prices for low-revenue issuers than for higher- revenue issuers. therefore, we continue to believe that the evidence supports the supposition that relative to higher-revenue issuers, the value of low-revenue issuers, on average, hinges more on their future prospects than on their current financial performance, and that this consideration should mitigate the potential adverse effects of the amendments. \\\\595\\\\ see letter from cfa. d. potential economic costs of effects on icfr, the reliability of financial statements, and potential fraud a number of commenters indicated that we should make further attempts to quantify the potential costs of the amendments.\\\\596\\\\ a few commenters further asserted that the costs of the amendments will significantly outweigh any benefits.\\\\597\\\\ in the previous section, we estimated that the affected issuers that will newly be exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements may eventually experience a 15 percentage point increase in ineffective icfr and, for a given year of financial statements, an estimated 2 percentage point increase in restatements, a 0.5 percentage point increase in item 4.02 restatements, and a 0.05 percentage point increase in ``financial reporting fraud'' associated with those financial statements. in this section, we provide additional monetized estimates of the impact, in dollar terms, which may be associated with certain potential adverse effects. as noted earlier, this discussion and these estimates are focused on affected issuers that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement and are not expected to be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement. \\\\596\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets, cfa inst., cii, prof. barth et al., and prof. ge et al. \\\\597\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets and prof. barth et al. overall, as discussed in more detail below, we are able to quantitatively estimate, per year per affected issuer, a total of approximately $60,000 in costs and an additional approximately $10,000 in transfers across shareholders, which represent costs to some shareholders and benefits to other shareholders.\\\\598\\\\ these estimates reflect our quantification, based on the available evidence and data, of potential effects related to operating performance, restatements, and financial reporting fraud. we note that we are unable to adjust the dominant component of the estimates (the estimated effect on operating performance) for the mitigating factors associated with low-revenue issuers that we discuss throughout this release, so the total estimate of costs may be inflated. \\\\598\\\\ the costs we estimate represent actual forgone value, while the transfers simply represent corrections to reflect an issuer's true financial position. given that our estimate of the cost savings per year per affected issuer is $210,000, we do not find evidence to support the views of the commenters that indicated that the costs of the amendments would significantly outweigh the benefits. however, we note two main caveats associated with our estimates of the costs and transfer that may result from the amendments, and with the underlying components of these estimates, which are discussed in more detail below. first, these estimates are necessarily more uncertain than our monetized estimates of cost savings to issuers because they are based on a larger number of assumptions. secondly, we caution against attempts to over-interpret the relation between our quantitative estimates of monetized benefits and monetized costs, because neither of these measures is complete. for example, we are not able to monetize the potential benefit of reduced management distraction from operating activities \\\\599\\\\ or the potential market-level costs of reduced efficiency of investor allocation across investment opportunities or reduced investor confidence.\\\\600\\\\ we therefore are not able to quantify the overall net benefit or cost of the amendments. \\\\599\\\\ see, e.g., letter from sutro. \\\\600\\\\ see, e.g., letter from cii. i. computation of monetized estimates of costs we provide further quantification of potential adverse effects of the amendments in this section, while the next section provides a discussion of these costs as well as other economic costs that we are unable to quantify. we begin by considering costs that may represent deadweight losses, or net costs to society, followed by a consideration of transfers across shareholders. first, we estimate the potential deadweight losses associated with a potential increase in the risk of fraud. in section iv.c.3.b.iv. above, we estimated the magnitude of the potential increase in fraud risk to be about $17,500 in market capitalization per year per affected issuer that will be newly exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirements. a study that breaks down the equity market impact of fraud into deadweight losses (such as legal costs and impaired reputation) versus the effects that reflect the market adjusting to a more accurate representation of issuers' financial situations estimates that the former constitute approximately 75 percent of the total equity market loss.\\\\601\\\\ we therefore estimate the potential average incremental deadweight loss associated with fraud to be $17,500 times 75 percent or roughly $13,000 per year per affected issuer. we consider the remainder of the estimated equity market effect, which represents a transfer from some investors to other investors, separately below. \\\\601\\\\ see karpoff et al. 2008 study, note 562 above. commenters suggested that we should quantify effects on operating performance associated with icfr misreporting,\\\\602\\\\ which are less likely to be corrected by remediation because the underlying material weaknesses are likely undetected. as discussed in the proposing release, potential effects of the amendments on operating performance are difficult to measure because the existing studies may not be generalizable to the affected issuers and the methods used in previous studies are difficult to apply to a comparable sample of low-revenue issuers in recent years.\\\\603\\\\ however, in response to these comments, we rely on the results of a recent study \\\\604\\\\ to provide an estimate of the possible loss in profits per year associated with icfr misreporting. while we expect that the anticipated effect on the affected issuers would be reduced relative to those in the study given the mitigating factors specific to low-revenue issuers discussed above, we are unable to estimate an appropriate adjustment to reflect these factors. the study estimates that the difference in return on assets for issuers misreporting that they have effective icfr versus those that properly report that they have ineffective icfr (and thereby perhaps also work towards remediating their icfr) is 3.3 percentage points over three years, or 1.1 percentage point per year. we multiply this difference by our estimate of the potential increase in misreporting of effective icfr from section iv.c.3.b.ii. above, which (based on statistics from the same study) is 3.5 percentage points, and the estimated average total assets of the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements from section iv.c.1 above, which is $125 million. this results in an estimated reduction in potential earnings of about $48,000 per year on average for an affected issuer. as noted above, this estimate may be inflated, as it does not reflect any of the mitigating factors specific to low-revenue issuers discussed above. \\\\602\\\\ see, e.g., letters from cii, prof. barth et al., and prof. ge et al. \\\\603\\\\ see section iii.c.4.c. of the proposing release, note 4 above. \\\\604\\\\ see ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above. in total, we estimate potential issuer-level costs of $48,000 in reduced earnings plus $13,000 in losses related to the increased risk of fraud, or roughly $60,000 in costs per year on average per affected issuer, though we view this estimate as conservative because it does not fully account for the mitigating factors discussed above. next, we note that some of the potential adverse effects quantified in section iv.c.3.b. above may be associated with stock market values that fail, at a given time, to reflect issuers' actual financial position. this potential inflation and later correction of stock market values would result in transfers that benefit some shareholders and harm other shareholders. further, the same shareholder may benefit in certain of his shareholdings and be harmed in other shareholdings. also, at any given time, the stock price may be inflated for certain reasons but have corrected for other prior inflation, depending on the timing of the revelation of the underlying issues. for the purpose of quantification of these potential transfers, we assume that issues are revealed gradually and smoothly over time, such that there is an even effect across years. the first source of mispricing we consider is misstatements that later translate into restatements. in section iv.c.3.b.iii. above, we estimated that the magnitude of the potential increase in item 4.02 restatements represented -$5,000 in stock market impact per year per affected issuer. secondly, we estimated earlier in this section that the magnitude of the potential increase in fraud risk is about -$17,500 in market capitalization per year per affected issuer, of which 25 percent or about -$4,500 reflects the market adjusting to a more accurate representation of issuers' financial situations.\\\\605\\\\ summing these quantified effects, and rounding up, we estimate that there may be approximately $10,000 of pure transfers across shareholders per year per affected issuer representing these corrections in stock values to reflect issuers' actual financial positions. \\\\605\\\\ we note that some portion of this correction may already be incorporated in our estimate with respect to restatements given that we do no separately consider restatements that are associated with specific charges or allegations versus other statements. as discussed above, these estimates are intended to be responsive to commenters who indicated that further quantitative analysis of the costs of the amendments would be appropriate. one commenter also provided alternative quantified estimates of the costs of expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement, estimating a $1.7 million loss in future earnings and $2.2 million in forgone market value per issuer.\\\\606\\\\ while we rely on evidence from the same underlying study that this commenter uses for some of our estimates, we do not rely on these specific estimates for two primary reasons. first, the underlying study indicates that these per issuer estimates apply not to all issuers but only to those issuers that are suspected of misreporting that their icfr is effective when exempted from the icfr attestation requirement, which the study estimates to be only 9.3 percent of the issuers.\\\\607\\\\ secondly, these estimates reflect aggregate effects over three years and we scale everything to annualized effects for better comparability.\\\\608\\\\ we also note that the estimate described by the commenter as forgone market value is described in the underlying study as a delay in a market value decline that would otherwise happen currently, not as an increase in market capitalization that could be captured under the icfr auditor attestation requirement.\\\\609\\\\ \\\\606\\\\ see letter from prof. barth et al. \\\\607\\\\ see ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above. \\\\608\\\\ id. \\\\609\\\\ id. in particular, this study estimates a stock market value correction that would be delayed until icfr misreporters experience the negative consequences of ineffective icfr (such as restatements or lower operating performance), rather than resulting immediately because of a disclosure of ineffective icfr. the study estimates that a $2.2 million stock market value correction would be delayed across a period of three years per suspected misreporter, who are estimated to represent 9.3 percent of the issuers exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. annualizing and generalizing the study's estimate across issuers' results in an estimated delayed stock market correction per year per affected issuer of about $70,000 ($2.2 million divided by three years times 9.3 percent). we note that this estimate is similar to the likely stock market impact of the quantified costs and transfers that we estimate may result from the adverse effects of removing the icfr auditor attestation requirement for the affected issuers (such as restatements and lower operating performance). in particular, our estimate of about $10,000 in potential transfers per year per affected issuer represents a $10,000 potential stock market correction per year per affected issuer. our estimate of quantified potential costs of about $60,000 per year per affected issuer would likely be reflected in a similarly-sized stock market reaction, for a further potential stock market correction of about $60,000 per year per affected issuer, and a total of about $70,000 ($10,000 plus $60,000) in stock market effects per year per affected issuer, the same as the estimate implied by the study. that said, we differ somewhat in the attribution of this total to deadweight costs versus transfers, as the ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above, suggests that the total estimated stock market effect may represent only a difference in timing of the effect and thus a transfer across shareholders. another commenter \\\\610\\\\ cited the same underlying study's \\\\611\\\\ estimates of quantified costs and benefits associated with the icfr auditor attestation. as discussed above, the study estimates, in aggregate and in present value terms, a total of $388 million in aggregate audit fee savings and a total of $719 million in lower earnings associated with exempting non-accelerated filers.\\\\612\\\\ while the commenter did not suggest that we adopt those specific estimates, we note that we do not rely directly on those estimates, which apply to a different context. in particular, the estimates in that study are intended to quantify the costs and benefits associated with the exemption that applies to all existing non-accelerated filers, versus those associated with extending the exemption to the smaller number and different type of affected issuers discussed in this release. however, as discussed in more detail throughout the release, we do rely on some results and approaches from that study in constructing our own estimates. \\\\610\\\\ see letter from prof. ge et al. \\\\611\\\\ see ge et al. 2017 study, note 393 above. \\\\612\\\\ this study also estimates a delay over three years in the timing of a market value decline (that would otherwise have occurred at the beginning of this three year period) of $935 million associated with the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. see section iv.c.2.b.ii. above. ii. discussion of economic costs while the previous section provided computations of monetary estimates of certain potential adverse effects of the amendments, this section provides further discussion of those costs as well as other economic costs that we are unable to quantify. per the discussion in section iv.c.3.a. above, any impact of the amendments on the effectiveness of icfr and the reliability of financial statements may have issuer-level implications as well as market-level implications. at the issuer level, the potential increase, on average, in the rate of ineffective icfr and restatements may lead investors to charge a somewhat higher average cost of capital for the affected issuers. an issuer's cost of capital, or the expected return that investors demand to hold its securities, determines the price at which it can raise funds. thus, any such increase may be associated with a reduction in capital formation to the extent that it decreases the rate at which the affected issuers raise new capital towards new investments. further, the affected issuers may also experience reduced operational efficiency because of the reduced reliability of financial information available to management for the purpose of making operating decisions. these potential effects are supported by a number of studies discussed above.\\\\613\\\\ finally, there may be legal and reputational costs associated with any increase in the risk of fraud, which would represent deadweight losses, or net costs to society. \\\\613\\\\ see section iv.c.3.a. above. several commenters expressed the view that eliminating the icfr auditor attestation requirement would increase the cost of capital for certain issuers because of the potential effects of this change on the reliability of the financial statements of the affected issuers.\\\\614\\\\ the potential issuer-level effect on the cost of capital is difficult to confirm and to quantify for the affected issuers because the existing studies may not be generalizable to the affected issuers and to the current nature of icfr auditor attestations (i.e., after the 2007 change in the icfr auditing standard, the 2010 change in risk assessment auditing standards, and recent pcaob inspections focused on these aspects of audits). further, some of these studies provide mixed evidence, as discussed in section iv.c.3.a. above. moreover, the methods used in previous studies are difficult to apply to a comparable sample of low-revenue issuers in more recent years because, for example, there would only be a small sample of such issuers that recently switched filing status and because methods of measuring the implied cost of capital are particularly problematic for such issuers.\\\\615\\\\ commenters did not provide us with estimates or data that could be used to estimate potential effects on the cost of capital. \\\\614\\\\ see, e.g., letters from bdo and cfa. \\\\615\\\\ see note 481 above. the available evidence supports the qualitative, directional effects on cost of capital noted above. that is, some of the affected issuers could experience an increase in their cost of capital. however, the previous section demonstrated that the potential increase in material weaknesses in icfr that we estimate could occur may translate into a more limited effect on the reliability of disclosures, as measured, for example, by the rate of restatements, for the affected issuers. also, based on our analysis, the financial metrics of these issuers have lower explanatory power for investors' determination of their value than in the case of other issuers. these two factors may mitigate the potential adverse effects on the affected issuers' cost of capital. in addition, some of the costs of extending the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement to additional issuers may be further mitigated by the fact that some issuers, even if exempted, may voluntarily choose to bear the costs of obtaining such an attestation.\\\\616\\\\ affected issuers that expect a lower cost of capital with an icfr auditor attestation, such as those with effective icfr,\\\\617\\\\ and particularly those that will be raising new debt or equity capital,\\\\618\\\\ are more likely to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation. we note that low-revenue issuers have less access to internally-generated capital, as discussed above, so they may be more reliant on external financing for capital. consistent with this argument, commenters suggested that issuers may voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation if it were demanded by investors,\\\\619\\\\ not complying would have a negative impact on investment analysts' coverage,\\\\620\\\\ or issuers deem it a good use of their capital resources.\\\\621\\\\ further, as discussed in section iv.c.4.d. below, we note that the benefits and therefore likelihood of voluntarily obtaining icfr auditor attestations may be increased by the new check- box disclosure on annual reports required by the amendments, in that investors should be more able to readily discern which issuers obtained an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\622\\\\ however, it is probably not the case that issuers would voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation in every case in which the total benefits of doing so would exceed the total costs.\\\\623\\\\ \\\\616\\\\ studies have associated voluntary compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement with decreased cost of capital and value enhancements. see, e.g., cory cassell, linda myers, & jian zhou, the effect of voluntary internal control audits on the cost of capital, working paper (2013) (cassell et al. 2013 study), available at ; todd kravet, sarah mcvay, & david weber, costs and benefits of internal control audits: evidence from m&a transactions, rev. of account. stud. (forthcoming 2018), available at ; and carnes et al. 2019 study, note 397 above. we note that the latter two studies are not able to differentiate between the effects of the icfr auditor attestation and of management's assessment of icfr under sox section 404(a). \\\\617\\\\ see brown et al. 2016 study, note 396 above. \\\\618\\\\ see cassell et al. 2013 study, note 616 above. \\\\619\\\\ see, e.g., letters from bio and guaranty. \\\\620\\\\ see, e.g., letter from guaranty. \\\\621\\\\ id. \\\\622\\\\ see 2013 gao study, note 246 above. \\\\623\\\\ there is substantial literature describing the fact that in certain circumstances the incentives of managers are not perfectly aligned with those of shareholders. see, e.g., michael jensen & william meckling, theory of the firm: managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure, 3(4) j. of fin. econ. 305 (1976). also, as discussed in section iv.c.3.a. above, the icfr auditor attestation requirement can have important market-level benefits through network and spillover effects that issuers are unlikely to internalize. that is, issuers are likely to balance the issuer-level benefits against the issuer-level costs of voluntary compliance without considering these externalities. the available evidence also supports the qualitative, directional effects on operating performance noted above. that is, some of the affected issuers could experience lower operating performance due to reliance on less reliable financial statements in their decision- making. like the potential effects on the cost of capital, the potential effect on issuer operating performance associated with reported ineffective icfr is also difficult to estimate and is likely to be mitigated by the multiple factors discussed above. further, the point estimates in one study demonstrate that issuers that remediate their reported material weaknesses in icfr might be able to make up a substantial amount of the previous operating underperformance.\\\\624\\\\ \\\\624\\\\ see feng et al. 2015 study, note 484 above, (with point estimates of a one percent reduction in roa in years with material weaknesses in icfr and a 2.6 percent increase in roa upon remediation, though there is significant uncertainty around these rates). we do, however, quantify potential effects on operating performance associated with icfr misreporting, which are less likely to be corrected by remediation because the underlying material weaknesses are likely undetected. we also estimate potential deadweight losses (e.g., legal and reputational costs) associated with a possible increase in the risk of fraud. in total, per section iv.c.3.d.i. above, we estimate potential issuer-level costs of $48,000 in reduced earnings plus $13,000 in losses related to the increased risk of fraud, or roughly $60,000 in costs per year on average per affected issuer, though we view this estimate as conservative because it does not fully account for the mitigating factors specific to low-revenue issuers discussed above. we note that issuers and other market participants may adapt to the proposed changes in various ways, which may serve to enhance or mitigate the anticipated issuer-level costs. however, these actions, and therefore their net effects, are difficult to predict. for example, it has been posited that issuers reacted to the requirements of sox by reducing accruals-based earnings management and, in its stead, making suboptimal business decisions for the purpose of real earnings management.\\\\625\\\\ it is therefore possible that newly exempt issuers could, to some extent, reduce real earnings management in favor of accruals-based management. another possibility is that scrutiny from analysts may provide an alternative source of discipline for some of the affected issuers, although there is evidence that analysts may stop covering issuers whose financial statements are deemed to have become less reliable.\\\\626\\\\ \\\\625\\\\ see daniel cohen, aiyesha dey, & thomas lys, real and accrual-based earnings management in the pre- and post-sarbanes oxley periods, 83(3) account. rev. 757 (2008) (finding that an increase in real earnings management partially offset the decrease in accruals-based earnings management that followed sox). see also coates and srinivasan 2014 study, note 369 above, at 646-647. \\\\626\\\\ see sarah clinton, arianna pinello, & hollis ashbaugh- skaife, the implications of ineffective internal control and sox 404 reporting for financial analysts,'' 33(4) j. of account. and pub. pol'y 303 (2013) (finding that the disclosure of internal control weaknesses is followed by a decline in analyst coverage). while the preceding analysis considers the average effects across the affected issuers on the effectiveness of icfr and the reliability of financial statements, the potential issuer-level costs of the proposed extension of the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement likely vary across different types of affected issuers. for example, the effects may vary based on issuers' proclivity to detect and disclose material weaknesses in icfr in the absence of an icfr auditor attestation requirement and whether the issuers' have characteristics that the market associates with having such material weaknesses. we discuss this variation in detail in the proposing release.\\\\627\\\\ \\\\627\\\\ see section iii.c.4.c. of the proposing release, note 4 above. we next consider effects at the market-level. some of these effects are associated with the transfers across shareholders that we estimated in section iv.c.3.d.i. above. in total, we estimated that there may be approximately $10,000 of pure transfers across shareholders per year per affected issuer representing corrections in stock values to reflect issuers' actual financial positions. these transfers and the associated mispricing may reduce the efficient allocation of capital at the market level. further, to the extent that the reliability of financial statements is somewhat reduced on average at the issuer level for the affected issuers, the efficient allocation of capital at the market level may be negatively affected given a diminished ability to reliably evaluate different investment alternatives.\\\\628\\\\ \\\\628\\\\ the efficient allocation of capital may be further reduced to the extent that the potential cost of capital effects discussed above operate through a reduction in the liquidity of the market for these issuers' shares, which increases the costs to investors looking to adjust their investments or redeploy their capital. see diamond and verrecchia 1991 study, note 477 above. the reduced reliability of financial statements could also negatively impact capital formation through a reduction in investor confidence. several commenters noted that they expected the amendments to have a negative effect on investor confidence.\\\\629\\\\ in contrast, one commenter asserted that there is no correlation between a smaller company's compliance with the icfr auditor attestation requirement and stronger markets in general,\\\\630\\\\ while two others noted that they did not expect effects on investor confidence with respect to affected issuers that are banks.\\\\631\\\\ \\\\629\\\\ see, e.g., letters from better markets and cii. \\\\630\\\\ see letter from bio. \\\\631\\\\ see letters from bsc and scba. section iv.c.3.a. provides additional discussion of these market- level factors. while we are unable to directly quantify the market- level effects on the efficient allocation of capital and on investor confidence, we anticipate that these effects may be limited due to the size of the expected effect on the reliability of these issuers' disclosures and potential transfers across shareholders as well as the small percentage of the total value of traded securities that is represented by the affected issuers. in particular, we estimate that the affected issuers that will be newly exempt from all icfr auditor attestation requirements represent 0.2 percent of the total equity market capitalization of issuers.\\\\632\\\\ \\\\632\\\\ this statistic is based on staff analysis of data from compustat. the total population of issuers used to construct this estimate are those that have annual reports on forms 10-k, 20-f, or 40-f in calendar year 2018 and data on market capitalization in compustat. see above note 336 for detail on the identification of affected issuers. 4. potential benefits and costs related to other aspects of the amendments in this section we consider the potential effects of the amendments with regard to other implications of accelerated filer status, specifically with respect to the timing of filing deadlines, certain required disclosures, and the determination of filer status. we also consider below some incremental effects of the amendments to the thresholds for exiting accelerated and large accelerated filer status and the new check-box disclosure required on the cover page of annual reports on form 10-k, 20-f, or 40-f. a. filing deadlines as discussed in section iv.b.1. above, non-accelerated filers are permitted an additional 15 days and five days, respectively, beyond the deadlines that apply to accelerated filers, to file their annual and quarterly reports. extending these later deadlines to the affected issuers may provide these issuers with additional flexibility in preparing their disclosures, while modestly decreasing the timeliness of the data for investors. table 6 in section iv.b.3. demonstrates that while the filing deadlines are not a binding constraint for most accelerated filers, with 63 percent filing their annual reports over five days early in recent years, some accelerated filers are likely to benefit from the extended deadline. for example, filing form nt automatically provides a grace period of an additional 15 days to file an annual report, and over the past four years, about four percent of accelerated filers filed their annual reports within this grace period rather than by the original deadline. a further five percent of accelerated filers filed their annual reports after these additional 15 days had passed. even affected issuers that would otherwise have filed by the accelerated filer deadline may avail themselves of the additional time provided under the amendments to balance other obligations or to prepare higher quality disclosures. the 2003 acceleration of filing deadlines for accelerated filers from 90 to 75 days was associated, at least initially, with a higher rate of restatements for the affected issuers.\\\\633\\\\ this finding suggests that a later deadline may allow some issuers to provide more reliable financial disclosures. while these issuers could alternatively file form nt to receive an automatic extension, studies have found that investors interpret such filings as a negative signal, resulting in a negative stock price reaction.\\\\634\\\\ issuers may thus prefer to meet the original deadline if possible. \\\\633\\\\ see, e.g., colleen boland, scott bronson, & chris hogan, accelerated filing deadlines, internal controls, and financial statement quality: the case of originating misstatements, 29(3) account. horizons 551 (2015) (``boland et al. 2015 study''); and lisa bryant-kutcher, emma yan peng, & david weber, regulating the timing of disclosure: insights from the acceleration of 10-k filing deadlines, 32(6) j. of account. and pub. pol'y 475- (2013). \\\\634\\\\ see joost impink, martien lubberink, & bart van praag, did accelerated filing requirements and sox section 404 affect the timeliness of 10-k filings?, 17(2) rev. of account. stud. 227 (2012) and eli bartov & yaniv konchitchki, sec filings, regulatory deadlines, and capital market consequences, 31(4) account. horizons 109 (2017). on the other hand, allowing the affected issuers to file according to the later non-accelerated filer deadlines may reduce the timeliness and therefore usefulness of the disclosures to investors. studies have found a reduction in the market reaction to disclosure when the reporting lag between the end of the period in question and the disclosure date is lengthy, as more of the information becomes available through other public channels.\\\\635\\\\ researchers have also questioned whether such lags increase information asymmetries, because some investors are more able to access or process information that could provide indirect insight into an issuer's financial status or performance through alternative channels.\\\\636\\\\ \\\\635\\\\ see, e.g., dan givoly & dan palmon, timeliness of annual earnings announcements: some empirical evidence, 57(3) account. rev. 486 (1982). \\\\636\\\\ see, e.g., nils hakansson, interim disclosure and public forecasts: an economic analysis and a framework for choice, 52(2) account. rev. 396 (1977) and baruch lev, toward a theory of equitable and efficient accounting policy, 63(1) account. rev. 1 (1988). we note that regulation fd generally prohibits public companies from disclosing nonpublic, material information to selected parties unless the information is distributed to the public first or simultaneously. see 17 cfr 243.100 to 17 cfr 243.103. one study found that the 2003 acceleration of filing deadlines was associated with a decrease in the market reaction to the disclosure of annual reports for accelerated filers.\\\\637\\\\ based on this result and supplementary tests regarding the change in disclosure quality and change in timeliness after the acceleration of deadlines, the authors concluded that the negative effect of the shorter deadline on the quality of disclosure appeared to dominate the beneficial effect on the timeliness of the disclosure for these issuers.\\\\638\\\\ while this finding might not be directly applicable 15 years later, and there is some evidence that some of these effects were temporary,\\\\639\\\\ in the absence of other evidence we expect the net effect of the extended filing deadlines to be beneficial on average but modest overall. one commenter, citing the complexity of current accounting standards and the volume of disclosure requirements, agreed that the benefits of the extended deadlines for the affected issuers were likely to outweigh their costs.\\\\640\\\\ other commenters did not opine on the costs and benefits of the changes in filing deadlines for the affected issuers. \\\\637\\\\ see jeffrey doyle & matthew magilke, decision usefulness and accelerated filing deadlines, 51(3) j. of account. res. 549 (2013). we note that this study found the reverse to be true for large accelerated filers. \\\\638\\\\ id. \\\\639\\\\ see, e.g., boland et al. 2015 study, note 633 above. \\\\640\\\\ see letter from bdo. b. disclosures required of accelerated filers non-accelerated filers are not required to provide disclosure regarding the availability of their filings under item 101(e)(4) of regulation s-k. while some investors may benefit from reduced search costs due to such disclosures, we do not expect that extending the exemption from these disclosures to the affected issuers will have significant economic effects. non-accelerated filers also are not required to provide disclosure required by item 1b of form 10-k or item 4a of form 20-f about unresolved staff comments on their periodic andor current reports. studies have found that the eventual disclosure of staff comments and related correspondence, as well as interim information about these comments before they are made public, are value-relevant (in that they affect the pricing of securities) for investors.\\\\641\\\\ while our understanding is that items 1b and 4a disclosures are relatively uncommon,\\\\642\\\\ extending the exemption from the requirement to disclose unresolved staff comments to the affected issuers may, in some circumstances, prevent the timely disclosure of value-relevant information to public market investors. moreover, because item 1b of form 10-k and item 4a of form 20-f requires unresolved staff comments to be disclosed if they were made not less than 180 days prior to the end of that fiscal year, issuers no longer subject to this disclosure requirement may have a reduced incentive to resolve comments in a timely manner, which could decrease the quality of reporting for the period over which comments continue to be unresolved. we did not receive any comments on these potential effects. \\\\641\\\\ see, e.g., patricia dechow, alastair lawrence, & james ryans, sec comment letters and insider sales, 91(2) account. rev. 401 (2015) and lauren cunningham, roy schmardebeck, & wei wang, sec comment letters and bank lending, working paper (2017), available at . \\\\642\\\\ based on staff analysis using the intelligize database, approximately 20 issuers included item 1b disclosures in forms 10-k filed in 2017. c. transition thresholds the amendments include revisions to the transition thresholds that address when an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer can transition into a different filer status. the amendments will allow accelerated or large accelerated filers to become non-accelerated filers if they qualify under the src revenue test or meet a revised public float transition threshold. an issuer whose revenues previously exceeded the src initial revenue threshold of $100 million will not qualify under the src revenue test unless its revenues fall below $80 million. the $80 million transition threshold for the src revenue test is 80 percent of the initial threshold of $100 million in revenue. an issuer whose public float previously exceeded the $75 million initial threshold for accelerated filer status will become a non-accelerated filer if its public float falls below $60 million, or 80 percent of that initial threshold, as opposed to the current threshold of $50 million. finally, the amendments also revise the public float transition threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status and becoming an accelerated filer from $500 million to $560 million in public float, or 80 percent of the $700 million entry threshold, to align with the transition threshold for entering src status after having exceeded $700 million in public float. the filer type exit thresholds in rule 12b-2 are set below the corresponding entry thresholds to provide some stability in issuer classification given normal variation in public float and revenues. the exact placement of these thresholds involves a tradeoff between the degree of volatility in classification versus the extent to which the categories persistently include issuers that are below the initial entry thresholds. the proposing release presented a quantitative analysis of this tradeoff using 20 years of data on the evolution of market capitalizations (as a proxy for public float) and revenues.\\\\643\\\\ in particular, this analysis demonstrated that a higher exit threshold is associated with more volatility in classification. for example, exit thresholds set at 100 percent of the public float entry thresholds would have led eight to ten percent of new entrants into a filer status to immediately exit the following year and then re-enter once again the year after that. issuers and investors may be confused as a result of such frequent fluctuations in filer type. they may also bear resulting costs, such as (for issuers) the cost of frequently revising their disclosure schedules and continually considering the impact of whether they are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement from one year to the next and (for investors) any incremental cost of evaluating the reliability of financial disclosures for an issuer that is not consistently subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement. \\\\643\\\\ see table 16 of the proposing release, note 4 above. on the other hand, the analysis in the proposing release also illustrated that a lower exit threshold is associated with a greater number of issuers remaining in a particular category despite falling below the entry threshold. for example, exit thresholds set at 60 percent of the public float entry thresholds would have prevented four to six percent of the new entrants into a filer status from exiting that status despite being below the entry threshold in the next two years. a low exit threshold can thus risk having a filer status effectively apply to a broader group of issuers than intended. the analysis in the proposing release further demonstrated that the balance between limiting filer status volatility while enabling filer status mobility provided by an exit threshold of 80 percent is similar around a $250 million, $75 million, and $700 million market capitalization. in particular, while five to six percent of the new entrants into a filer status would be expected to transition out and back into the status in the following two years, one to two percent of those entrants would be expected to remain within the same filer status despite being below the entry threshold for the two following years. we therefore expect the increase in the public float thresholds to exit accelerated and large accelerated filer status to $60 and $560 million, or 80 percent of the entry threshold in each case, to lead to a similar tradeoff in these factors as the 80 percent public float threshold to re-enter src status. one commenter noted that certain of the affected issuers may recognize revenues unevenly across periods due to certain collaborative arrangements.\\\\644\\\\ when considering issuers that have empirically crossed a $100 million revenue entry threshold in the past, the analysis in the proposing release demonstrated that, on average, these issuers would not be subject to significant volatility in classification. thus, while some issuers may be subject to such volatility,\\\\645\\\\ this does not appear to be a widespread concern. in fact, the analysis in the proposing release demonstrated that revenue is on average more stable than market capitalization, so the 80 percent threshold in the revenue test for exiting accelerated and large accelerated filer status is expected to provide a lower degree of filer status fluctuations for a comparable degree of filer status mobility. overall, we expect the amended transition thresholds to provide a tradeoff between filer status mobility and volatility that is consistent with the tradeoff provided by the recently revised src transition provisions. \\\\644\\\\ see letter from ey. \\\\645\\\\ issuers that expect significant volatility in their classification could consider voluntarily obtaining an icfr auditor attestation in years where one is not required, given that commenters suggested that there would be no significant cost savings from obtaining an icfr auditor attestation every three years as opposed to annually. see, e.g., letters from crowe and kpmg. d. disclosure the amendments add a check box to the cover pages of forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f to indicate whether an icfr auditor attestation is included in the filing. while filer status is reported prominently on the cover page of annual reports for most issuers, there is currently not similarly prominent disclosure of whether an icfr auditor attestation is provided. such disclosure has been recommended by the gao,\\\\646\\\\ as well as some commenters.\\\\647\\\\ \\\\646\\\\ see 2013 gao study, note 246 above. \\\\647\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq, cfa inst., cii, grant thornton, and kpmg. investors can already ascertain whether an icfr auditor attestation is included by searching within an issuer's annual report, and including additional items on the annual report cover page could marginally decrease the salience of each item already reported there. however, several commenters noted that it is currently difficult for investors to easily determine whether an issuer's filing includes an icfr auditor attestation.\\\\648\\\\ the cover page check box disclosure requirement will make it easier for investors to identify issuers that undergo an icfr auditor attestation with only minimal additional disclosure expense for registrants. this may, on the margin, increase the efficiency of investment decisions and the allocation of capital across the market. it may also enhance the value to issuers of pursuing an icfr auditor attestation, even when one is not required, by making it more likely that investors recognize that an issuer has obtained an icfr auditor attestation and therefore account for this factor in their investment decisions. while issuers that voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation would bear additional costs to do so, we expect they would voluntarily bear these costs only if they believe that the associated issuer-level benefits (e.g., a reduced cost of capital) would more than offset those costs. thus, to the extent that more prominent disclosure would enhance these benefits, it may be a positive factor in the decision of additional firms to voluntarily obtain an icfr auditor attestation. such voluntary action by some of the issuers for which the requirement will be eliminated could, as discussed above, mitigate some of the potential negative effects of the amendments, although it is difficult to predict the frequency with which voluntary compliance might occur. \\\\648\\\\ see, e.g., letters from caq, cfa inst., and grant thornton. see also 2013 gao study, note 246 above. 5. alternatives to the amendments below we consider the relative costs and benefits of reasonable alternatives to the implementation choices in the amendments. a. exclude all srcs from accelerated filer category we considered excluding all srcs from the accelerated filer definition, consistent with the past alignment of the src and non- accelerated filer categories. this alternative would include srcs that meet the revenue test, as under the adopted amendments, as well as those that have a public float of less than $250 million when initially determining src status. several commenters supported this approach.\\\\649\\\\ \\\\649\\\\ see, e.g., letters from asa, guaranty, nam, and nasdaq. this alternative would have several benefits, such as promoting regulatory simplicity and reducing any frictions or confusion caused by issuers having to make multiple determinations of their filer type. this alternative would also expand the benefits of the amendments to additional issuers. we estimate that 268 additional issuers \\\\650\\\\ would be non-accelerated filers rather than accelerated filers under this alternative, of which 48 are egcs and 220 would newly be exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement under sox section 404(b) (although we estimate that six of these newly exempt filers would still be subject to the fdic auditor attestation requirement). in the proposing release,\\\\651\\\\ we performed an analysis of the audit fees of lower-float issuers of different types and estimated an average compliance cost savings of $415,000 per year for the additional issuers that would be affected under this alternative, with some of these issuers experiencing lesser or greater savings. this likely represents a significant cost savings for issuers with less than $250 million in public float and may thus have beneficial economic effects on competition and capital formation. as discussed above, smaller issuers generally bear proportionately higher compliance costs than larger issuers. reducing these additional issuers' costs would reduce their overhead expenses and may enhance their ability to compete with larger issuers. to the extent that the cost savings for the additional affected issuers enable capital investments that would not otherwise be made, this alternative would also lead to additional benefits in capital formation. \\\\650\\\\ this estimate is based on staff analysis of the number of accelerated filers in 2018 with public float of at least $60 million but less than $250 million and prior fiscal year revenues (or, in the case of bdcs, investment income) of at least $100 million and that are eligible to be srcs (i.e., excluding abs issuers, rics, bdcs, subsidiaries of non-srcs, and fpis filing on foreign forms or using ifrs) or are bdcs (though we estimate that there are no bdcs that meet these criteria). revenue data is sourced from xbrl filings, compustat, and calcbench. see note 298 above for details on the identification of the population of accelerated filers. we note that the incremental number of affected issuers could be higher than this estimate because there are approximately 65 issuers for which filer status andor public float data are not available (and revenue data is either unavailable or revenues are at least $100 million). \\\\651\\\\ see section iii.c.6.a. of the proposing release, note 4 above. however, we expect the costs of this alternative to be greater than for the amendments, primarily due to the broader application of the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement and the diminished impact of some of the mitigating factors discussed in section iv.c.3. above on srcs that meet the public float test rather than the revenue test. in particular, we estimated in the proposing release \\\\652\\\\ that extending the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement to issuers that are eligible to be srcs based on their public float may result in an average increase in the rate of ineffective icfr of about 25 percentage points among these issuers, somewhat higher than our estimate for low-revenue issuers. the analysis in the proposing release \\\\653\\\\ also demonstrated that low public float issuers restate their financial statements at rates comparable to higher public float issuers, unlike low-revenue issuers, whose restatement rates were three to nine percentage points lower than for higher-revenue issuers of the same filer status. we therefore believe that the proposition that low-revenue issuers may, on average, be less susceptible to certain kinds of misstatements may not apply to the same extent to issuers with low public float. we estimated in the proposing release that the increase in restatement rates for the additional affected issuers may be comparable to the two percentage points we estimated for low-revenue issuers, but that, in contrast to the results for low-revenue issuers, this would likely result in higher restatement rates for the additional affected issuers than for the higher public float issuers that would remain accelerated filers. \\\\652\\\\ id. \\\\653\\\\ id. the proposing release also tested whether the potential adverse impact of such a change may be mitigated by a lower empirical relevance of financial statements for the market valuation of these issuers. however, we did not find evidence that the market relies on financial statements to a lesser extent for the valuation of issuers with public float less than $250 million (as compared to issuers with a larger public float), and so this further mitigating factor that applies to low-revenue issuers likely does not apply equally to lower public float issuers. finally, as in section iv.c.3., we re-examined responses to the 2008-09 survey. when asked about the net benefits of complying with sox section 404, 16 percent of respondents at accelerated filers with public float of less than $250 million claimed that the costs far outweighed the benefits, in contrast to, as reported above, 30 percent of respondents at accelerated filers with revenues of less than $100 million.\\\\654\\\\ while this survey data is somewhat dated, it provides an indication as to the perception by executives at issuers at that time of the relative costs and benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement. to the extent that this perception is borne out by the actual costs and benefits of the icfr auditor attestation requirement for issuers that meet the src revenue test and for those that would otherwise be srcs under the public float test, this data may suggest that low-revenue issuers would benefit more from qualifying as non- accelerated filers than would other types of srcs. \\\\654\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of data from the 2008-09 survey. the analysis considers responses pertaining to the most recent year for which a given respondent provided a response. we note that the rate of responses to the question about net benefits was lower than for other questions. see 2009 sec staff study, note 304 above, and alexander et al. 2013 study, note 401 above, for details on the survey and analysis methodology. we did not receive any comments on our analysis of the benefits and costs of extending non-accelerated filer status to all srcs. b. include or exclude certain issuer types alternatively, we considered approaches that would include or exclude additional issuer types, or apply different requirements to particular issuer types. for example, we could extend non-accelerated filer status to other issuers with between $75 million and $700 million in public float that meet the src revenue test but would not be eligible to be srcs because they are majority-owned subsidiaries of non-srcs. however, in the proposing release, we estimated that only one majority-owned subsidiary of a non-src parent would meet the same public float and revenue thresholds as the affected issuers. given the minimal number of such issuers and the responsibilities of the parent of any such issuers with respect to the icfr of their subsidiaries, we expect the incremental costs and benefits of this alternative to be minimal. as discussed above, in a change from the proposal, the final amendments also exclude bdcs from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions under circumstances that are analogous to the exclusions for other issuers under the amendments. we estimate that approximately 28 bdcs will therefore be affected by the amendments, of which seven are egcs and therefore already exempt from the icfr auditor attestation requirement. we recognize, as stated in the proposing release, that investors in bdcs generally may place greater significance on the financial reporting of bdcs relative to low-revenue non-investment company issuers. however, given the small number of bdcs, it is difficult to assess to what extent our findings with respect to the anticipated costs and benefits of the amendments for the broader pool of affected issuers would apply similarly to bdcs as an isolated subset of these issuers.\\\\655\\\\ we note, however, that one commenter urged that we pursue the adopted approach, stating that, among other reasons, ``[a]llowing smaller bdcs to benefit from non-accelerated filer status, and thereby ease regulatory costs and burdens, could encourage more bdcs to enter the public markets, creating greater access to capital for small operating companies and expanding investment opportunities for retail investors.''.\\\\656\\\\ given the limited number of affected issuers that are bdcs, we preliminarily expect the aggregate incremental costs and benefits of this alternative relative to the adopted approach to be modest, as compared to the universe of form 10-k filers, although they could be significant for any particular issuer and significant for traded bdcs as a class of form 10-k filers as we estimate the total number of traded bdc filers to be 51 (of which seven have a market capitalization below $75 million and would be already considered non-accelerated filers).\\\\657\\\\ \\\\655\\\\ while more refined analysis is difficult, we note that, for the 54 to 75 bdcs for which a management report on icfr is available in audit analytics for years 2014 through 2017, the rate of ineffective icfr reported by management is 9.0 percent, the rate of restatements is 9.8 percent, and the rate of item 4.02 restatements is 2.3 percent on average across these years, which are comparable to the corresponding rates for all accelerated filers other than egcs under the baseline. see section iv.b.4. above. \\\\656\\\\ see letter from proskauer. \\\\657\\\\ nontraded bdcs also file on form 10-k, but these issuers are already non-accelerated filers because they do not have public float. we also considered alternative thresholds for bdcs, given that bdcs do not report revenue on their financial statements. the amendments exclude a bdc from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2 if the bdc: (1) has a public float of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million; and (2) has investment income of less than $100 million. table 16 below provides statistics from the proposing release on other income-related metrics for bdcs with between $70 million and $700 million in public float.\\\\658\\\\ \\\\658\\\\ this analysis used market capitalization valuations as of february 2019 to determine the set of potentially affected bdcs under different alternatives. while this methodology is different than the approach used by rule 12b-2, which uses the aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of the issuer's most recent second fiscal quarter, we do not believe that it would substantially change our analysis. this analysis did not remove bdcs who may qualify as non-accelerated filers based on their status as egcs. after identifying the set of potentially affected bdcs, our staff manually reviewed the then-most recent form 10-k filed on our edgar system for each bdc. the affected parties estimates in section iv.c.1. above uses self-identified filer status to identify affected bdcs (as well as other affected issuers), rather than using market capitalization data for this purpose. in particular, current status as an accelerated filer implies that the issuer's rule 12b-2 public float does not exceed $700 million. see above note 336. also, the public float of the affected bdcs was manually collected for the purpose of related statistics in section iv.c.1. see notes 356, 366, and 367 above. table 16characteristics of bdcs with market capitalization between $75 and $700 million [in millions] net increase in net realized and net assets market investment income unrealized gains resulting from capitalization as for most recent and losses for operations for of february 2019 fiscal year most recent most recent fiscal year fiscal year high $507.91 $108.28 $43.12 60.69 low 89.69 1.62

large accelerated filer to exclude bdcs suggested that we exclude entities with total investment income of less than $80 million in the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and either no public float or public float of less than $700 million. of the 29 bdcs identified in the proposing release with a market capitalization between $75 million and $700 million, 28 had investment income of below $100 million and 26 had investment income of below $80 million. we therefore anticipate that the incremental costs and benefits of a threshold of $80 million in investment income as compared to the adopted threshold of $100 million in investment income would be limited. we also considered whether to require or permit bdcs to provide an independent public accountant's report on internal controls, similar to the one required by rics on form n-cen, since both rics and bdcs prepare financial statements under article 6 of regulation s-x, in place of the auditor attestation required by sox section 404(b). we considered whether such a substitution should be permitted for all bdcs or only required for those bdcs that would no longer be required to provide a report under sox section 404(b). we do not have any data and did not receive any public comment, however, regarding the potential benefits and costs of using a form n-cen-type report on internal controls as compared to the auditor attestation required by sox section 404(b). we also considered excluding all fpis, which are included in the affected issuers to the extent that they meet the required thresholds and other qualifications, from the amendments. researchers have found that the restatement rates of foreign issuers may be artificially depressed due to a lower likelihood of detection and disclosure of misstatements for these issuers.\\\\659\\\\ it is therefore possible that encouraging more effective icfr through an icfr auditor attestation requirement may be particularly important for such issuers. on the other hand, because low-revenue fpis may have similar characteristics to low-revenue domestic issuers, including them in the group of affected issuers may help to maintain an even playing field for competition amongst these issuers and avoid discouraging foreign companies from issuing securities in you.s. public markets. the amendments attempt to strike a balance between these considerations by allowing fpis to avail themselves of the amendments only if they file on domestic forms and present their financial statements pursuant to you.s. gaap, as well as meeting the required thresholds and other qualifications.\\\\660\\\\ because of limitations in the availability of data such as filing status or public float for many fpis, we are unable to reliably measure the potential effects for this subset of issuers. commenters did not provide data that would allow us to further analyze the potential effects for these issuers. \\\\659\\\\ see, e.g., suraj srinivasan, aida sijamic wahid, & gwen yu, admitting mistakes: home country effect on the reliability of restatement reporting, 90(3) account. rev. 1201 (2015). \\\\660\\\\ while we currently estimate that no fpis would currently qualify based on these requirements, we note that there are fpis that otherwise meet the required thresholds and other qualifications and that might choose to file on domestic forms using you.s. gaap in order to benefit from the amendments as well as the scaled disclosure accommodations available to srcs if these benefits outweigh the costs of changing their disclosure regime. c. alternative threshold we considered alternative levels at which a revenue threshold could be set. a $100 million dollar revenue threshold was recommended, in conjunction with a public float threshold, for the accelerated filer definition as well as the src definition by the 2017 small business forum and a participant at the september 2017 meeting of the former advisory committee on small and emerging companies (``acsec'').\\\\661\\\\ the $100 million threshold is also aligned with the src revenue test. empirically, we find no obvious break in the distribution of revenue or in the results of our analysis. in general, lowering the revenue threshold would reduce the expected benefits of the amendments by reducing the number of issuers that would experience cost savings, while also reducing the expected costs of the amendments by reducing the potential adverse impact on the reliability of financial statements. increasing the threshold would increase the expected benefits while also increasing the expected costs. we did not receive comments on the costs or benefits of alternative levels of a revenue threshold or of alternative metrics that should be used instead of revenue (except in the case of bdcs, as discussed above). \\\\661\\\\ see final report of the 2017 sec government business forum on small business capital formation

paperwork reduction act a. summary of the collections of information certain provisions of our rules and forms that would be affected by the amendments contain ``collection of information'' requirements within the meaning of the paperwork reduction act (``pra''). the commission published a notice requesting comment on the collection of information requirements in the proposing release, and submitted the proposed amendments to the office of management and budget (``omb'') for review in accordance with the pra.\\\\662\\\\ while several commenters provided comments on the possible costs of the proposed amendments,\\\\663\\\\ no commenters specifically addressed our pra analysis. where appropriate, we have revised our burden estimates after considering these comments as well as differences between the proposed and final rules. \\\\662\\\\ 44 you.s.c. 3507(d) and 5 cfr 1320.11. \\\\663\\\\ see, e.g., letters from ardelyx presentation, cerecor, cfa, cfa inst., cii, concert, corvus, guaranty, icba, nasdaq, pieris, prof. barth et al., prof. ge et al., summit, syros, and terra tech. the hours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms and reports constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information requirement unless it displays a currently valid omb control number. compliance with the information collections is mandatory. responses to the information collections are not kept confidential and there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed. the titles for the affected collections of information are: ``form 10-k'' (omb control no. 3235-0063); \\\\664\\\\ and \\\\664\\\\ the paperwork burden from 17 cfr 240.12b-1 through 240.12b-37 (``regulation 12b'') is imposed through the forms that are subject to the requirements in that regulation and is reflected in the analyses of those forms. our estimate for forms 10-k takes into account the burden that will be incurred by including the disclosure in the applicable annual report. after the proposing release, note 4 above, was issued, the office of management and budget (``omb'') discontinued the omb control number for regulation 12b, so that the pra inventory would not reflect duplicative burdens. ``form 10-q'' \\\\665\\\\ (omb control no. 3235-0070).\\\\666\\\\ \\\\665\\\\ 17 cfr 249.308a. \\\\666\\\\ the only revision to this form will be changing filing deadlines, which will neither increase nor decrease the burden hours necessary to prepare the filing because there will be no change to the amount of information required in the filing. the regulation and forms listed above were adopted under the exchange act. the regulation and forms set forth the disclosure requirements for periodic reports filed by registrants to help investors make informed investment decisions. a description of the final amendments, including the need for the information and its use, as well as a description of the likely respondents, can be found in section ii above, and a discussion of the economic effects of the final amendments can be found in section iv above. b. burden and cost estimates related to the final amendments we estimate that the final amendments will result in approximately 527 additional issuers being classified as non-accelerated filers.\\\\667\\\\ accelerated filers are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement and shorter deadlines for filing their exchange act periodic reports.\\\\668\\\\ additionally, accelerated filers must provide disclosure regarding the availability of their filings and the disclosure required by item 1b of form 10-k and item 4a of form 20-f about unresolved staff comments on their periodic andor current reports.\\\\669\\\\ \\\\667\\\\ see section iv.c.1. above. we estimate that there are no fpis that file on domestic forms and present their financial statements pursuant to you.s. gaap that would meet the required thresholds and other qualifications of the amendments. however, there are an estimated 31 fpis that file on forms only available to fpis, but otherwise meet the required thresholds and other qualifications. in the proposing release, note 4 above, we included fpis that file the forms available only to fpis, but otherwise meet the required thresholds and other qualifications, in the number of affected issuers. while these issuers could become subject to the amendments by changing their reporting regime, it is difficult to predict how many would do so, as a result, we do not include them in the number of affected issuers in this release. accordingly, we do not estimate any effect on the collections of information corresponding to forms 20-f or 40-f. \\\\668\\\\ see section ii.a. above. \\\\669\\\\ see note 25 above. 1. icfr auditor attestation requirement we believe that expanding the exemption from the icfr auditor attestation requirement would reduce the pra burden for 373 of the 527 affected issuers.\\\\670\\\\ an icfr auditor attestation is required only in annual reports. table 17, below, shows the estimated number of affected issuers that are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement that file on each of these forms and the average estimated audit-fee and non-audit costs, as described above,\\\\671\\\\ to comply with the icfr auditor attestation requirement. \\\\670\\\\ we estimate that the remaining 154 of the 527 affected issuers are egcs, which are not required to comply with the icfr auditor attestation requirement under sox section 404(b). see section iv.c.1. above. in addition to the 154 egcs, we estimate that a further 78 of the 527 affected issuers are currently also subject to the fdic's auditor attestation requirement. see section 18a of appendix a to fdic rule 363. these issuers would continue to incur burden hours and costs associated with an auditor attestation requirement even under the final amendments. however, the fdic's auditor attestation requirement is not part of our rules. for purposes of considering the pra effects of the final amendments, therefore, we have reduced the burden hours and costs for these 78 issuers as we would for the other affected issuers that are not egcs. \\\\671\\\\ see sections iv.c.3. and iv.c.5. above. table 17estimated annual costs per issuer of icfr auditor attestation requirement for specified forms number of form type affected audit-fee costs non-audit costs issuers per issuer per issuer form 10-k 373 $110,000 $100,000 because these issuers would no longer be subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement under the final amendments, they would no longer incur these costs. for purposes of the pra, this reduction in total burden is to be allocated between a reduction in internal burden hours and a reduction in outside professional costs. table 18, below, sets forth the percentage estimates we typically use for the burden allocation for each form. table 18standard estimated burden allocation for specified forms outside form type internal professionals (%) (%) form 10-k 75 25 for the $100,000 reduction in annual non-audit costs,\\\\672\\\\ we allocate the burden based on the percentages in table 18 above. however, we believe that 100 percent of the $110,000 annual burden reduction for audit-fee costs related to the icfr auditor attestation requirement should be ascribed to outside professional costs because that amount is an estimate of fees paid to the independent auditor conducting the icfr attestation audit. table 19, below, shows the resulting estimated reduction in cost per issuer associated with outside professionals. \\\\672\\\\ as discussed in section iv.c.3, above, in deriving this estimate of the reduction in non-audit costs, we have looked to outside vendor and internal labor costs, and not to non-labor costs, because we believe that those non-labor costs (such as software, hardware, and travel costs) are primarily attributable to management's icfr responsibilities under sox section 404(a) and thus would continue to be incurred. to the extent elimination of the auditor attestation requirement also results in a reduction in management's time burden, we believe this reduction generally would be captured by the estimated $100,000 reduction, as this amount reflects an overall reduction in non-audit costs. table 19estimated reduction in outside professional costs from elimination of icfr auditor attestation requirement total outside outside outside professional total reduction professional professional costs per number of in outside issuer type (form used) costs per costs per

purposes, an issuer's internal burden is estimated in internal burden hours. we are, therefore, converting the internal portions of the non-audit costs to burden hours. these activities would mostly be performed by a number of different employees with different levels of knowledge, expertise, and responsibility. we believe these internal labor costs will be less than the $400 per hour figure we typically use for outside professionals retained by the issuer. therefore, we use an average rate of $200 per hour to estimate an issuer's internal non-audit labor costs. table 20, below, shows the resulting estimated reduction in internal burden hours from the elimination of the icfr auditor attestation requirement. table 20estimated reduction in internal burden hours from elimination of icfr auditor attestation requirement internal cost number of total reduction issuer type (form used) per issuer (non- burden hours affected in internal audit) per issuer issuers burden hours [a] [b]

changing filing deadlines neither increases nor decreases the burden hours necessary to prepare the filing because there is no change to the amount of information required in the filing.\\\\673\\\\ therefore, we do not believe that the change to the filing deadlines will affect an issuer's burden hours or costs for pra purposes. \\\\673\\\\ revisions to accelerated filer definition and accelerated deadlines for filing periodic reports, release no. 33-8644 (december 21, 2005) [70 fr 76634 (december 27, 2005)]. we believe that eliminating the requirements to provide disclosure regarding the availability of their filings and the disclosure required by item 1b of form 10-k and item 4a of form 20-f about unresolved staff comments on their periodic andor current reports will reduce their burden hours and costs, but we do not expect that reduction to be significant. for purposes of the pra, we estimate the reduction to be approximately one hour for each affected issuer.\\\\674\\\\ however, as opposed to the burden reduction resulting from the elimination of the icfr auditor attestation requirement, which would apply only to 373 of the 527 total affected issuers that are not egcs, the burden reduction from eliminating these disclosure requirements will apply to all the 527 affected issuers, including the 154 affected issuers that are egcs. that reduction is allocated by form as shown in table 21, below. \\\\674\\\\ we believe that this one-hour reduction will be solely for an issuer's internal burden hours. table 21estimated reduction in internal burden hours per issuer from elimination of disclosure requirements regarding filing availability and unresolved staff comments number of reduction in form type burden hours affected internal burden per issuer issuers hours [a] [b] [c] (b x c) [d] form 10-k 1 527 527 3. check box disclosure in a change from the proposed amendments, the final amendments add a check box to the cover pages of their annual reports on forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f for issuers to indicate that they included an icfr auditor attestation in the filing. in addition, if the issuer is otherwise required to tag cover page disclosure data using inline xbrl, it must also to tag the cover page check box disclosure using inline xbrl. issuers must already determine whether they are subject to the icfr auditor attestation requirement, so requiring issuers to add a check box to the cover pages of their annual reports on forms 10-k, 20- f, and 40-f, and check that box if they provide the icfr auditor attestation, will not substantively modify existing collection of information requirements or otherwise affect the overall burden estimates associated with these forms. therefore, we are not adjusting any burden or cost estimates in connection with the check box requirement in the final amendments 4. total burden reduction table 22, below, shows the total estimated reduction in internal burden

rules under section 553 of the administrative procedure act,\\\\676\\\\ to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. we have prepared this final regulatory flexibility analysis (``frfa'') in accordance with section 604 of the rfa.\\\\677\\\\ this frfa relates to the amendments to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2 under the exchange act and the addition of a check box to the cover pages of forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f to indicate whether an icfr auditor attestation is included in the filing. an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (``irfa'') was prepared in accordance with the rfa and was included in the proposing release. \\\\675\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 601 et seq. \\\\676\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 553. \\\\677\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 604. a. need for, and objectives of, the final amendments the purpose of the amendments to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions in rule 12b-2 is to promote capital formation by more appropriately tailoring the types of issuers that are included in the category of accelerated filers and revising the transition thresholds for accelerated and large accelerated filers. the addition of the check box to the cover pages of forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f is intended to provide more prominent and easily accessible disclosure of this information for investors and market participants while imposing only minimal burdens on issuers. the need for, and objectives of, the amendments are discussed in more detail in sections i and ii above. b. significant issues raised by public comments in the proposing release, we requested comment on all aspects of the irfa, including the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed amendments, the existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis, and how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments. we did not receive any comments specifically addressing the irfa. however, we received a number of comments on the proposed amendments, generally,\\\\678\\\\ and have considered all of these comments in developing the frfa because the final amendments are focused on smaller issuers. \\\\678\\\\ see section ii.b.2. above. we believe that the final amendments will reduce disclosure burdens by expanding the number of registrants that will no longer qualify as accelerated or large accelerated filers, which will eliminate the icfr auditor attestation requirement for those issuers, while maintaining investor protections. c. small entities subject to the amendments the final amendments will affect some registrants that are small entities. the rfa defines ``small entity'' to mean ``small business,'' ``small organization,'' or ``small governmental jurisdiction.'' \\\\679\\\\ for purposes of the rfa, under our rules, an issuer, other than an investment company, is a ``small business'' or ``small organization'' if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year.\\\\680\\\\ \\\\679\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 601(6). \\\\680\\\\ see 17 cfr 240.0-10(a) under the exchange act. we estimate that there are 1,171 issuers that file with the commission, other than investment companies, which may be considered small entities and are potentially subject to the final amendments.\\\\681\\\\ investment companies, which include bdcs, qualify as small entities if, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, they have net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of their most recent fiscal year.\\\\682\\\\ commission staff estimates that, as of june 2019, approximately 16 bdcs are small entities.\\\\683\\\\ we believe it is likely that virtually all issuers that would be considered small businesses or small organizations, as defined in our rules, are already non-accelerated filers and would continue to be encompassed within that category. to the extent any such issuers are not already non-accelerated filers, we believe it is likely that the final amendments will capture those entities. \\\\681\\\\ this estimate is based on staff analysis of issuers, excluding co-registrants, with edgar filings of form 10-k, 20-f and 40-f, or amendments, filed during the calendar year of january 1, 2018 to december 31, 2018. this analysis is based on data from xbrl filings, compustat, and ives group audit analytics. \\\\682\\\\ 17 cfr 270.0-10(a). \\\\683\\\\ these estimates are based on staff analysis of morningstar data and data submitted by investment company registrants in forms filed on edgar as of june 2019. d. projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements as noted above, the final amendments will reduce the number of accelerated and large accelerated filers, which will reduce the compliance burden for those issuers, some of which may be small entities, because they would no longer have to satisfy the icfr auditor attestation requirement, comply with accelerated deadlines for filing their exchange act periodic reports, provide disclosure regarding the availability of their filings, or provide disclosure required by item 1b of form 10-k and item 4a of form 20-f about unresolved staff comments on their periodic andor current reports.\\\\684\\\\ the icfr auditor attestation requirement applies only to accelerated and large accelerated filers, and most small entities would not qualify for either filer status. compliance with certain rules affected by the amendments require the use of professional skills, including accounting and legal skills. the final amendments are discussed in detail in sections i and ii above. we discuss the economic effect including the estimated costs and burdens, of the final amendments on all registrants, including small entities, in section iv above. \\\\684\\\\ the amendments to include a check box on forms 10-k, 20-f, and 40-f are not expected to affect the overall burden estimates associated with these forms. see section v.c.3. above. e. agency action to minimize effect on small entities the rfa directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse effect on small entities. accordingly, we considered the following alternatives: establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for small entities under our rules as revised by the amendments; using performance rather than design standards; and exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of the amendments. we do not believe that establishing different compliance or reporting obligations in conjunction with the final amendments is necessary. the final amendments would not impose any significant new compliance obligations. in fact, the final amendments would reduce the compliance obligations of affected issuers by increasing the number of issuers, including small entities, that are subject to the different, less burdensome, compliance and reporting obligations for non- accelerated filers. similarly, because the final amendments would reduce the burdens for these issuers, we do not believe it is appropriate to exempt small entities from all or part of the proposed amendments. we believe that some of the issuers that would become eligible to be non-accelerated filers under the final amendments may be smaller entities. therefore, to the extent that any small entities would become newly eligible for non-accelerated filer status under the final amendments, their compliance and reporting requirements would be further simplified. we note in this regard that the commission's existing disclosure requirements provide for scaled disclosure requirements and other accommodations for small entities, and the final amendments would not alter these existing accommodations. the check box requirement should not affect small entities unless they voluntarily choose to comply with the icfr auditor attestation requirements. further, we note that the compliance burden associated with the check box is expected to be minimal, and establishing a different compliance requirement, providing additional clarification of the requirement, or exempting a small entity would not, therefore, have a meaningful impact on the small entity. finally, with respect to the use of performance rather than design standards, because the final amendments are not expected to have any significant adverse effect on small entities (and may, in fact, relieve burdens for some such entities), we do not believe it is necessary to use performance standards in connection with this rulemaking. statutory authority and text of rule amendments the rule amendments described in this release are being adopted pursuant to

treasury (treasury department) and the irs published in the federal register (88 fr 68525) a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed regulations) by cross-reference to an interim final rule (reg-106203-23) proposing amendments to regulations under 26 cfr part 300. on the same date, the treasury department and the irs published in the federal register (88 fr 68456) an interim final rule (td 9980) that reduced the ptin user fee from $21 per application or application for renewal to $11, plus the fee payable directly to a third-party contractor. the interim final rule and the proposed regulations took into account the february 2023 memorandum opinion of the united states district court for the district of columbia in steele v. united states, 657 f.supp.3d 23 (d.d.c. 2023). the preamble to the interim final rule contains a detailed explanation of the legal background and user fee calculations regarding the amendments to these regulations. no public hearing was requested or held, and no comments were received on the proposed regulations. these final regulations therefore adopt the text of the interim final rule and proposed regulations without change. special analyses i. regulatory planning and review the omb's office of information and regulatory analysis has determined that these final regulations are not significant and are not subject to review under section 6(b) of executive order 12866, as amended. ii. regulatory flexibility act pursuant to the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6), it is hereby certified that these final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. these regulations affect all individuals who prepare or assist in preparing all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund for compensation. only individuals, not businesses, can have a ptin. thus, the economic impact of these regulations on any small entity generally will be a result of an individual tax return preparer who is required to have a ptin owning a small business or a small business otherwise employing an individual tax return preparer who is required to have a ptin. the treasury department and the irs estimate that approximately 847,555 individuals will apply annually for an initial or renewal ptin. although these regulations will likely affect a substantial number of small entities, the economic impact on those entities is not significant. these regulations establish an $11 fee per application or application for renewal (plus the fee payable directly to the third- party contractor), which is a reduction from the previously established fee, and will therefore not have a significant economic impact on small entities. accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. iii. unfunded mandates reform act section 202 of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 (umra) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. these final regulations do not include any federal mandate that may result in expenditures by state, local, or tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of that threshold. iv. executive order 13132: federalism executive order 13132 (federalism) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the executive order. these final regulations do not have federalism implications and do not impose substantial direct compliance costs on state and local governments or preempt state law within the meaning of the executive order. v. submission to small business administration pursuant to section

act, 2020, public law 116-94, 133 stat. 2534, 3226, amended section 7508a of the code, relating to the discretionary authority of the secretary of the treasury or her delegate (secretary) to postpone certain time-sensitive tax deadlines by reason of a federally declared disaster, by adding section 7508a(d). this provision provides qualified taxpayers a mandatory 60-day period that is to be disregarded ``in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' on january 13, 2021, the irs published in the federal register a notice of proposed rulemaking (reg-115057-20, 86 fr 2607) to interpret and implement sections 165(i)(5) and 7508a(d). five responsive written comments were received. no commenter requested a public hearing, so none was held. as described more fully in the preamble to the proposed regulations, section 7508a(d) is ambiguous in at least two important respectsthe time-sensitive acts to be postponed (beyond the pension- related actions described in section 7508a(d)(4)) are not specified and it is unclear how the mandatory 60-day postponement period is to be calculated when the disaster declaration specified in section 7508a(d) does not contain an incident date. the legislative history is also insufficient to explain these areas of ambiguity. these final regulations amend the procedure and administration regulations (26 cfr part 301) under section 7508a and the income tax regulations (26 cfr part 1) under section 165 to clarify the definition of the term ``federally declared disaster.'' as described further below, the department of the treasury (treasury department) and the irs have modified proposed sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii), example (3), in these final regulations to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period and to correct typographical errors. no other changes have been adopted. comments on the proposed regulations section 1.165-11(b)(1) the proposed regulations provided that a federally declared disaster includes both a major disaster and an emergency declared under sections 401 or 501, respectively, of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (stafford act), public law 100- 707,102 stat. 4689 (1988). one commenter said it approved of the proposed regulations including emergency declarations in the definition of a federally declared disaster under section 165(i)(5)(a). however, another commenter was critical of this portion of the proposed regulations and recommended that it be stricken. this second commenter said emergency declarations are governed by a different set of rules than major disaster declarations, pointing out that emergency declarations (i) do not need to be preceded by a governor's request for stafford act relief (but may instead be declared sua sponte by the president), (ii) may only result (if not followed up by a major disaster declaration) in federal assistance to local governmental entities (as opposed to assistance to individuals), and (iii) may be issued before a disaster. this commenter further opined that president trump's letter of march 13, 2020, declaring an emergency under the stafford act with respect to the covid-19 pandemic, was not authorized by congress to serve as a disaster declaration under sections 165(i)(5)(a) and 7508a of the code. the comment from the second commenter is not adopted in the final regulations. in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part iii. federally declared disasters, this issue is already addressed in detail. there is no provision in the stafford act to declare a ``disaster.'' the legislative history of the stafford act indicates that the term ``disaster'' is an umbrella term that includes both an emergency and a major disaster. the conference report to the disaster relief and emergency assistance act of 1974, public law 93-288, 88 stat. 143 (1974), clarified the definitional section of the stafford act, stating: ``it was the intention of the conferees not to define the term `disaster' specifically; whenever used in this legislation such term includes an emergency or a major disaster.'' h.r. rep. 93-1037, p. 26 (may 13, 1974). the opening section of the stafford act, titled ``congressional findings and declarations,'' uses the generic term ``disaster'' in laying out the key congressional findings and declarations that underlie the rest of the chapter's provisions. stafford act section 101(a), 42 you.s.c. 5121(a). in multiple revenue rulings, the irs has provided that, for the purposes of section 165(i), a federally declared disaster includes an emergency or a major disaster declared under the stafford act. several of these revenue rulings are cited in the preamble to the proposed regulations. the differences noted by the commenter between emergencies and major disasters under the stafford act are not material to their treatment under sections 165(i)(5)(a) and 7508a of the code. most disaster declarations announced by the federal emergency management agency (fema) for particular states also provide only public assistance, and no individual assistance, to particular counties in the state under the stafford act. in addition, most emergency declarations announced by fema are under section 501(a) of the stafford act, and begin with a request from a governor or other chief executive of a state, territory, or tribal government. as noted in the preamble to the proposed regulations, it is rare for an emergency declaration to be made without such a request. the president is authorized to make an emergency declaration under section 501(b) of the stafford act when the united states will have the primary responsibility for response to the emergency. there is no difference in the need for affected persons in a state threatened with a disaster to receive relief from time-sensitive deadlines to perform specified acts under the code when the request for such relief originates with the state's governor or is independently raised by the president. consequently, the final regulations make no changes to this portion of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(1)-(2) the proposed regulations provided that (excluding the pension- related acts described in section 7508a(d)(4)) the time-sensitive tax acts that are postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period are the acts, if any, that the secretary determines to be postponed under section 7508a(a) or (b). one commenter expressed a general concern that this provision had the potential to reduce section 7508a(d) to a nullity. a second commenter expressed its concerns specifically in terms of what it contended was a clear reading of the statute and its legislative history. this commenter said it was clear that congress intended to postpone the timely performance of all of the time-sensitive tax acts, both taxpayer and government acts, listed in section 7508(a)(1) of the code. however, this second commenter recommended that the final regulations provide that the government may take advantage of the postponement periods for government-initiated actions only if a taxpayer first acts in reliance on the ``automatic'' postponement periods for the taxpayer's time-sensitive tax acts. a third commenter agreed with the secretary's characterizations of the statute and legislative history as ambiguous on the issues of which time-sensitive tax acts (other than the pension-related tax acts described in section 7508a(d)(4)) are postponed under section 7508a(d) and of which declared disasters are subject to the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d). this commenter approved of the solution to these ambiguities that was reflected in the proposed regulations, in terms of which time-sensitive tax acts would be postponed. this commenter said section 7508a(d) was a poorly-worded statute, that the legislative history of the provisions contained contradictions, and the result was that section 7508a(d)(1) leaves no (non-pension) time-sensitive tax acts for section 7508a(d) to operate upon, unless or until the secretary exercises her powers under section 7508a(a). the third commenter noted also that for the year 2017, the irs provided relief under section 7508a(a) in response to only 14 of the 59 major disaster declarations announced by fema that year. if all major disaster declarations automatically entitled all taxpayers in disaster areas to timing relief under section 7508a(d), the commenter noted that there would be a dramatic increase in the number of disasters leading to postponements of time-sensitive tax acts. on these issues, the third commenter concluded that the proposed regulations properly preserved the discretion of the irs to determine which declared disasters should result in any type of disaster relief and of which time-sensitive tax acts should be postponed under section 7508a. the comments from the first two commenters on this issue are not adopted in the final regulations, while the approving comments of the third commenter were already reflected in the proposed regulations. as explained more fully in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part i. time-sensitive tax acts, and as noted by the third commenter described above, except for the rules regarding pensions described in section 7508a(d)(4), section 7508a(d), by its terms, does not specify the time-sensitive tax acts to be postponed during the mandatory 60-day postponement period. instead, section 7508a(d)(1) provides that the mandatory 60-day postponement period ``shall be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' section 7508a(a) is not self-executing, but rather, requires a determination by the secretary to specify the acts to be postponed. as a result, the cross-reference to section 7508a(a) in section 7508a(d)(1) operates to require the same determination by the secretary as a prerequisite to determining the acts to which the mandatory 60-day postponement period applies. this interpretation gives full effect to the statutory language and does not reduce section 7508a(d) to a nullity, because that section still imposes a mandatory period for postponement and establishes a new category of persons eligible for reliefthe ``qualified taxpayers'' defined in section 7508a(d)(2). the final regulations make no changes to sec. 301.7508a- 1(g)(1) and (2) of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i) section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i) of the proposed regulations tracked section 7508a(d)(1) and (d)(5) in describing how the mandatory 60-day postponement period for federally declared disasters will be calculated and how the calculation of that mandatory postponement period will interact with the secretary's discretionary postponement period (if any) under section 7508a(a) and (b). the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part ii. calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period, identified a 120-day postponement period from the beginning incident date of a disaster announced by fema as the usual postponement period provided by the irs for those disasters where the irs exercises its discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) to postpone any time-sensitive tax acts. consequently, most mandatory 60-day postponement periods under section 7508a(d) will be calculated to run concurrently with the 120- day postponement period the irs generally provides under section 7508a(a) or (b). two commenters noted that section 7508a(d)(1) and the proposed regulations did not provide a clear rule for calculating the mandatory 60-day postponement period when there was more than one disaster declaration issued for the same disaster in a particular state or when any disaster declaration was amended to provide any new or modified incident dates (earliest or latest) that were missing or different from when the first disaster declaration for a disaster in a state was announced by fema. two commenters suggested potential alternative methods of making calculations of the mandatory 60-day postponement period more certain when there are multiple disaster declarations or disaster declarations that are amended by fema for the earliest or latest incident dates described in section 7508a(d)(1)(a) and (b). one commenter claimed that a literal reading of section 7508a(d)(1) creates challenges for indefinite disasters, such as the covid-19 pandemic, because the statute could be interpreted to postpone a taxpayer's deadlines ``indefinitely until some unknown point in time that is long after the disaster began.'' to avoid this ``unworkable application'' of the statute, this commenter recommended that if the initial disaster declaration does not expressly identify the latest incident date for a disaster, then section 7508a(d) should be interpreted as automatically providing a postponement period until the date that is 60 days after the earliest incident date specified in a disaster declaration. however, the statute mitigates the commenter's concern by directing that the postponement period under section 7508a(d) ``shall be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under subsection (a).'' that provision ensures that the secretary retains the same discretion as she has under section 7508a(a) to determine what time-sensitive tax acts, if any, will be postponed. a second commenter noted what it characterized as a pick-and-choose problem and an amendment problem with the method of calculating the mandatory 60-day postponement period provided for in the proposed regulations and recommended the secretary adopt one of several alternative bright-line rules it suggested for making the calculation period more predictable. this second commenter noted there was a potential pick-and-choose problem among multiple potential fema-announced disaster declarations, because the treasury department and the irs propose to treat fema- announced emergency declarations (as well as major disaster declarations) under the stafford act as federally declared disasters under sections 165 and 7508a of the code. this commenter's recommendation to strike proposed amended regulation sec. 1.165- 11(b)(1) is discussed and rejected in the preamble discussion of this issue above. alternatively, the second commenter recommended that the final regulations reflect a bright-line rule to address potential multiple declarations, such as a first-out rule (the first issued declaration controls), a rule that a later major disaster declaration controls over an earlier emergency declaration, or a rule that the issue date of an emergency declaration is the earliest incident date for section 7508a(d)(1)'s mandatory 60-day postponement period. the second commenter further recommended in this section of the final regulations that the treasury department and the irs provide a bright-line rule concerning the effect of potential amendments to an initial fema announced disaster declaration on how the mandatory 60-day postponement period is calculated. the additional potential bright-line alternatives suggested by the second commenter were that (i) future amendments will not affect how the mandatory period is calculated, or (ii) only amendments made within a certain amount of time (say one year) will affect the computation of the mandatory period. the treasury department and the irs appreciate the predictability offered by the bright-line rules suggested by the second commenter. nevertheless, the statutory language providing for a mandatory period beginning on the earliest incident date specified in the disaster declaration and ending on the date which is 60 days after the latest incident date so specified is capable of being applied as written. while amendments to disaster declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates can cause confusion, the intent of the statute is to ensure that relief is provided throughout the disaster period, assuming such a period is identified in the disaster declaration and the secretary has determined that postponement of time-sensitive tax acts is warranted. as a result, the comment on this issue is not adopted in the final regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(ii)(a) the proposed regulations provided that in no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year. one commenter stated that this portion of the proposed regulations should be removed because it lacks any basis in the text or legislative history of section 7508a(d)(1) or (d)(4). the comment on this issue is not adopted in the final regulations. as stated in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part ii. calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period, it defies logic for the secretary's discretionary postponement period under section 7508a(a) to be limited to ``a period of up to 1 year,'' and there be no limit on the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d). interpreting section 7508a(d) to allow postponement periods for more than 1 year would be contrary to the directive of section 7508a(d)(1) that the mandatory 60- day postponement period must ``be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' the final regulations make no change to sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(ii)(a) of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii) example (3) the proposed regulations provided an example (3) concerning a continuing disaster declaration involving wildfires that was later amended by a subsequent fema announcement of a latest incident date for the disaster. this example contained typographical errors, including a misnumbering``(5)'' instead of ``(4)''of the subparagraph for the four examples and referring to the taxpayer in the example variously as ``individual c'' and ``individual d.'' one commenter further noted that the intended rules, if any, which example (3) was meant to illustrate were not described in the portions of the proposed regulations which precede the examples section. example (3) is intended to illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period in the event of an ongoing disaster with multiple declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates described in sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3) of these final regulations. the treasury department and the irs have modified example (3) in these final regulations, in consideration of the comment above as well as the comments received on sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i), to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period and to correct typographical errors. section 301.7508a-1(h)(2) the proposed regulations provided that the final regulations shall apply to all disasters declared on or after december 21, 2019. one commenter requested not only that the final regulations not be retroactive to the effective date of section 7508a(d), but that the final regulations provide relief to any individuals or employee benefit plans that took actions (or failed to take actions) based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the postponement relief provided in section 7508a. the commenter further requested that such good faith relief be available for at least 60 days after the final regulations are published in the federal register. the applicability date discussion in the preamble to the proposed regulations clearly indicated the intention of the treasury department and the irs to rely on the provisions of section 7805(b)(2) of the code for the applicability date of these final regulations. section 7805(b)(2) provides that regulations filed or issued within 18 months of the date of enactment of the statutory provision to which the regulations relate are not prohibited from applying retroactively to the date of enactment. section 7508a(d) was enacted on december 20, 2019, and these final regulations have been filed or issued within 18 months of that date of enactment. the proposed regulations were clear in stating that the treasury department and the irs intended for the final regulations to apply to any disasters that were declared on or after december 21, 2019. these final regulations do not adopt the commenter's request to modify sec. 301.7508a-1(h)(2) of the proposed regulations. new rule proposal one commenter requested that the final regulations ``confirm'' that all forms of deadline relief requested under section 7508a are optional for affected taxpayers. in particular, the commenter focused on deadlines arising under employee benefit plans. in some cases, the application of these deadlines may affect both the plan and the participants. after consideration, the treasury department and the irs have concluded that the suggestions made in this comment are beyond the intended scope of the proposed regulations. consequently, the suggestions are not adopted in these final regulations. modifications of proposed regulations section 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii) example (3) example (3) is modified to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period in the event of multiple declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates, and to correct typographical errors. applicability dates for date of applicability for the amendment to the procedure and administration regulations under section 7508a, see sec. 301.7508a- 1(h), which provides that the regulations promulgated by this treasury decision are applicable for federally declared disasters that are declared on or after december 21, 2019, as explained in the preamble to the proposed regulations (reg-115057-20) published in the federal register (86 fr 2607), because section 7805(b)(2) of the internal revenue code (code) provides that regulations filed or issued within 18 months of the date of the enactment of the statutory provision to which they relate may apply to taxable periods prior to those described in section 7805(b)(1) and these final regulations are being published within 18 months of the enactment of section 7508a(d) on december 20, 2019. the date of applicability for the amendment to the income tax regulations under section 165 of the code to clarify the definition of the term ``federally declared disaster'' is june 11, 2021. special analyses certain irs regulations, including these, are exempt from the requirements of executive order 12866, as supplemented and affirmed by executive order 13563. therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. pursuant to the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6), it is hereby certified that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. the regulations clarify how the secretary may postpone certain time- sensitive tax deadlines by reason of a federally declared disaster. such postponements provide more time for affected taxpayers to complete time-sensitive acts than they otherwise would have under the internal revenue laws. in addition, the regulations do not impose a collection of information burden on any person, including small entities, for purposes of the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6). accordingly, the secretary certifies that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. pursuant to section 7805(f) of the internal revenue code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these final regulations was submitted to the chief counsel for advocacy of the small business administration for comments on its impact on small business, and no comments were received. drafting information the principal authors of these final regulations are andrew c. keaton and william v. spatz of the office of associate chief counsel (procedure and administration). however, other personnel from the treasury department and the irs participated in their development. list of subjects 26 cfr part 1 income taxes, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 26 cfr part 301 employment taxes,

(3) calculation of mandatory 60-day postponement period(i) in general. the mandatory 60-day postponement period begins on the earliest incident date specified in a disaster declaration for a federally declared disaster and ends on the date that is 60 days after the latest incident date specified in the disaster declaration. in accordance with section 7508a(d)(5), the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d) runs concurrently with the postponement period determined by the secretary in exercising discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) if the period determined by the secretary is equal to or longer than 60 days after the latest incident date. if the period determined by the secretary in exercising discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) ends prior to 60 days after the latest incident date, in accordance with section 7508a(d)(5), the mandatory 60-day postponement period will run concurrently for the length of the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b) and then continue running in addition to the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b). (ii) limitations on the mandatory 60-day postponement period. (a) in no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year. (b) in the event the secretary determines to postpone time- sensitive acts pursuant to a declaration establishing a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508a that does not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508a(d). in such cases, the only postponement period will be the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b). (4) examples. the rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples: (i) example (1). individual a lives in a state that experienced severe but isolated tornado damage on march 15. on march 20, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president for the state where individual a lives, describing the incident date for the tornado as march 15. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs published a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from march 15 through july 31, pursuant to section 7508a(a). the county where individual a lives was included in the news release. under section 7508a(d), the mandatory 60-day postponement period that individual a is entitled to begins on march 15 and ends 60 days after march 15, on may 14. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual a under section 7508a(a). (ii) example (2). individual b lives in a coastal state which experienced harmful effects from a hurricane that began to affect the weather in his state on august 15 and ceased to be a weather factor in his state on august 19. on august 22, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president, determining that the coastline counties in the state, including the county where individual b lives, were severely affected and that these counties were entitled to both individual assistance and public assistance. the major disaster declaration specified the earliest incident date for the hurricane in the state where individual b lives as august 15 and the latest incident date as august 19. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs published a news release identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from august 15 through december 31, pursuant to section 7508a(a). under section 7508a(d), the mandatory 60- day postponement period that individual b is entitled to begins on august 15 and ends 60 days after august 19, on october 18. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual b under section 7508a(a). (iii) example (3). individual c lives in a county of a state that is experiencing ongoing wildfires. on august 14, fema issued a federal register notice announcing an emergency declaration approved by the president to make public assistance available under the stafford act to local governments to fight the wildfires. this declaration specified an earliest incident date of august 14 and no latest incident date. on august 17, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president for the same wildfires incident, announcing that the residents of the county where individual c lives were eligible to receive individual assistance under the stafford act. this declaration specified august 15 as the earliest incident date and described the incident period as ongoing. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs exercised its discretion under section 7508a(a) to publish a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the wildfires disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying both the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from august 15 through december 15. following the initial news release, the wildfires disaster remained ongoing, with no ending incident date specified, for several months. the irs published a second news release postponing the time-sensitive acts through january 15. fema subsequently amended the major disaster declaration to specify the latest incident date of november 19. because the irs acted in its discretion to provide relief in response to the major disaster declaration, and not to provide relief in response to the emergency declaration, the mandatory 60-day postponement period that individual c is entitled to under section 7508a(d) begins on august 15, the earliest incident date specified in the major disaster declaration, and ends 60 days after the latest incident date of november 19. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual c under section 7508a(a), and ends on january 18, which is 60 days after the latest incident date and three days beyond the postponement period specified by the irs under section 7508a(a) in its news release. (iv) example (4). individual d lives in the united states, which is experiencing a nationwide emergency as a result of its residents being exposed to a highly infectious and dangerous pandemic disease. on march 13, the president declared a nationwide emergency under section 501(b) of the stafford act. the pandemic became a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508a on march 13, however, no incident date was specified in the president's emergency declaration. pursuant to the president's march 13 emergency declaration, the irs published several notices identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement that generally ran from april 1 through july 15, pursuant to section 7508a(a). because, in this circumstance, the emergency declaration pursuant to which the notices were published did not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508a(d). the only postponement period is the period determined by the secretary pursuant to the discretionary authority under section 7508a(a). (h) applicability dates(1) in general. except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to disasters declared after january 15, 2009. (2) paragraph (g) of this section. paragraph (g) of this section applies to disasters declared on or after december 21, 2019. douglas w. o'donnell, deputy commissioner for services and enforcement. approved: may 25, 2021. mark j. mazur, assistant secretary of the treasury (tax policy).

discussion the commission is adopting amendments to correct errors in certain commission rules and forms. specifically, the amendments correct errors in the formula for calculating yield data reported on form n-mfp, which requires money market funds to report portfolio and other information to the commission each month. the amendments also make conforming changes to the risk disclosure statement in rule 482, which requires certain information to be included in mutual fund advertisements and sales literature. the amendments also conform certain provisions of form n-1a and form n-2, forms used by open-end management investment companies (``open-end funds'') and closed-end funds, respectively, to register under the investment company act and to offer their shares under the securities act. these amendments reflect recent rule changes requiring open-end funds to transmit more concise annual and semi- annual reports to shareholders. further, the amendments correct outdated cross- references and redesignate the numbering of certain paragraphs within form n-csr, a reporting form used by funds to file shareholder reports under the investment company act and the exchange act. the amendments also correct an erroneous cross-reference in rule 204-2, which prescribes recordkeeping requirements for investment advisers. finally, the amendments insert inadvertently omitted office of management and budget (``omb'') control numbers in 17 cfr 200.800, which is a rule that displays control numbers omb has assigned to existing information collection requirements pursuant to the paperwork reduction act. although the amendments are effective immediately, to the extent that registrants need additional time to conform to the amendments, they may take up to 90 days after the effective date to comply.\\\\12\\\\ given the nature of the amendments, a 90-day compliance period gives registrants adequate time to review these amendments and, if necessary, update their practices to reflect the corrections. \\\\12\\\\ see also infra section i.c (stating that funds may include the updates to item 10(a)(1)(iii) of form n-1a in their next annual prospectus update following the adoption of the amendments to form n-1a). a. form n-mfp the commission is adopting amendments to correct errors in form n- mfp. money market funds use form n-mfp to report portfolio and other information to the commission each month. among the items required by form n-mfp is the reporting of a money market fund's 7-day annualized gross and net yields. the form requires money market funds to report 7- day gross yield at the series level and 7-day net yield at the class level.\\\\13\\\\ these standardized metrics give investors the ability to view the yield information of a money market fund over a recent time period, allowing investors to make better informed decisions and, in the aggregate, provide the commission with useful data for identifying and monitoring trends in the money market fund sector. \\\\13\\\\ see items a.19 and b.8 of form n-mfp. in 2023, the commission adopted a rulemaking that changed the frequency at which funds are required to report the 7-day yield information in their monthly reports on form n-mfp to require 7-day gross and net yield data for each business day of the month (instead of only the 7 days ended on the last day of the month).\\\\14\\\\ \\\\14\\\\ see money market fund reforms; form pf reporting requirements for large liquidity fund advisers; technical amendments to form n-csr and form n-1a, investment company act release no. 34959 (july 12, 2023) [88 fr 51404 (august 3, 2023)] (``money market fund reform adopting release''), available at . in making this frequency-related change, the phrase ``business days'' was erroneously inserted into the yield calculation formula in a way that inadvertently altered the calculation period from 7 calendar days to 7 business days. a 7-business day period is internally inconsistent with the remainder of the yield calculation formula, which uses a scaling factor intended to annualize yields calculated over 7 calendar days. if used with a 7-business day period, it would result in the reporting of inflated annual yields on form n-mfp.\\\\15\\\\ based on a review of a sample of recent form n-mfp filings, commission staff has not observed any evidence of an increase in reported yield figures relative to yields reported in prior periods, suggesting that money market funds' yield calculations do not reflect the error.\\\\16\\\\ in addition, in amending form n-mfp in 2023, the phrase ``immediately preceding'' was inadvertently inserted into the yield calculation formula, such that the reporting day would not be included in the calculation. the amendments correct these errors, ensuring that form n- mfp continues to reflect the longstanding method money market funds have used to calculate and report yield figures (measured over seven calendar days) to the commission in form n-mfp and in other contexts, including prospectuses, advertisements, and sales literature.\\\\17\\\\ \\\\15\\\\ the yield calculation formula in items a.19 and b.8 (by reference to item 26(a)(1) of form n-1a) includes a scaling factor of 3657, which operates to annualize yields calculated over a period of 7 calendar days. due to the inclusion of weekends and holidays, however, 7 business days span a longer calendar period than 7 calendar days. accordingly, yields calculated over 7 business days but annualized over 7 calendar days would result in inflated annual yields. see infra footnote 45. \\\\16\\\\ see infra footnote 45 and accompanying text. \\\\17\\\\ see item 26(a) of form n-1a (requiring money market funds to base yield calculations on the 7 days ended on the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the registration statement); item 24(a) of form n-4 (at 17 cfr 239.17b and 274.11c) (requiring a prospectus for an account or sub-account that holds itself out as a money market account or sub-account to be calculated based on the 7 days ended on the date of the most recent balance sheet of the registrant included in the registration statement); paragraph (e)(1) of 17 cfr 230.482 (requiring that any quotation of a money market fund's yield in an advertisement be based on the methods of computation prescribed in form n-1a or form n-4); paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 17 cfr 270.34b-1 (requiring a money market fund's sales literature that includes any quotation of yield or similar quotations purporting to demonstrate the income earned or distributions made by the fund to be accompanied by a quotation of current yield based on the computation method prescribed in form n- 1a or form n-4). b. rule 482(b)(4) we are amending rule 482 to correct outdated cross-references and conform the risk statements that money market funds must include in their advertisements and sales literature to the risk statements that money market funds must include in their prospectuses.\\\\18\\\\ rule 482 applies to advertisements or other sales materials with respect to securities of an investment company registered under the investment company act that is selling or proposing to sell its securities pursuant to a registration statement that has been filed under the investment company act.\\\\19\\\\ this rule describes the information that is required to be included in an advertisement, including a disclosure statement that must be used on money market fund advertisements.\\\\20\\\\ \\\\18\\\\ see amended rule 482(b)(4). the regulations at 17 cfr 270.34b-1 (rule 34b-1) cross reference paragraph (b)(4) of rule 482, so the amendments will update the risk statements that money market funds must include in sales literature under rule 34b-1 as well. for purposes of this release, we use the term ``advertisement'' to include both rule 482 advertisements and rule 34b-1 sales literature, unless otherwise specified. \\\\19\\\\ see rule 482(a). \\\\20\\\\ see rule 482(b). in the money market fund reform adopting release, the commission amended the risk statements that money market funds must include in their prospectuses to align with the changes to money market fund regulations adopted in that release (e.g., the removal of provisions allowing temporary suspensions of redemptions and changes to the liquidity fee framework). however, rule 482 was not included in the amendments and the statements that rule 482 currently requires are inconsistent with the recently amended regulatory framework for money market funds.\\\\21\\\\ further, the risk statements that money market funds were required to include in prospectuses and advertisements have otherwise always been identical and the risk statements should not differ based on whether an investor is reviewing a prospectus or an advertisement.\\\\22\\\\ \\\\21\\\\ see item 4(b)(1)(ii) of form n-1a. \\\\22\\\\ see revisions to rules regulating money market funds, investment

been removed or significantly modified in underlying money market fund regulations (e.g., allowing temporary suspensions of redemptions). the amendments to rule 482 would correct this error, make certain other conforming edits to further align the language of the risk statements with the risk statements that money market funds must include in their prospectuses, and correct inaccurate cross references to money market fund rules.\\\\23\\\\ \\\\23\\\\ for example, the amendments correct errors in cross references to the definitions of government money market fund and retail money market fund located in 17 cfr 270.2a-7 (rule 2a-7), as well as cross references to the location of liquidity fee provisions in that rule. c. form n-1a we are amending a provision of form n-1a to correct a cross reference, reflecting changes made in the tailored shareholder reports adopting release.\\\\24\\\\ specifically, we are amending item 10(a)(1)(iii) of form n-1a. this item requires open-end funds to include prospectus disclosure stating that a discussion regarding the basis for the board of directors approving any advisory contract of the fund is available in the fund's annual or semi-annual report to shareholders, as applicable.\\\\25\\\\ in the tailored shareholder reports adopting release, however, the commission adopted amendments requiring discussion regarding the basis for the board's approval of the advisory contract to be included on form n-csr rather than in the annual or semi-annual report.\\\\26\\\\ we are accordingly amending item 10(a)(1)(iii) to reference that this disclosure now appears in the fund's reports on form n- csr.\\\\27\\\\ because this change simply updates a cross reference, funds may include the updated language in their next annual prospectus update following the adoption of the amendments to form n-1a and we anticipate funds would update this disclosure at that time. in the interim period before funds make this update, an investor who wants to review the discussion regarding the basis for the board's approval of the advisory contract would look in the fund's shareholder report (which is referenced in the current prospectus disclosure requirement).\\\\28\\\\ while this discussion will no longer appear in the fund's shareholder report, the report will include a link to additional information about the fund, which includes the discussion regarding the basis for the board's approval of the advisory contract. \\\\24\\\\ see tailored shareholder reports for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds; fee information in investment company advertisements, investment company act release no. 34731 (october 26, 2022) [87 fr 72758 (november 25, 2022)] (``tailored shareholder reports adopting release''), available at . \\\\25\\\\ see item 10(a)(1)(iii) of form n-1a (``include a statement, adjacent to the disclosure required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this item, that a discussion regarding the basis for the board of directors approving any investment advisory contract of the fund is available in the fund's annual or semi-annual report to shareholders, as applicable, and providing the period covered by the relevant annual or semi-annual report.''). \\\\26\\\\ see form n-csr item 11 (statement regarding basis for approval of investment advisory contract). \\\\27\\\\ as amended, item 10(a)(1)(iii) will read: ``include a statement, adjacent to the disclosure required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this item, that a discussion regarding the basis for the board of directors approving any investment advisory contract of the fund is available in the fund's reports filed on form n-csr, and providing the period covered by the most recent form n-csr report that includes this discussion.'' \\\\28\\\\ see item 27a(b)(4) of form n-1a (shareholder report cover page must include a website address where additional information about the fund, as required under 17 cfr 270.30e-1 (rule 30e-1), is available); rule 30e-1(b)(2) under the investment company act (content requirements for additional information that an open-end fund must make available on a website, including the discussion regarding the basis for the board's approval of the advisory contract). d. form n-2 we are amending instruction 8.a to item 24 of form n-2 to correct a cross-reference to a provision of form n-csr that became outdated when the commission adopted amendments to form n-csr in the tailored shareholder reports adopting release. instruction 8.a refers to item 7 of form n-csr (``disclosure of proxy voting policies and procedures for closed-end management investment companies''), which was redesignated as item 12 (but not otherwise changed) in the tailored shareholder reports adopting release.\\\\29\\\\ we are therefore amending the reference in item 7 in instruction 8.a to refer instead to item 12. \\\\29\\\\ see tailored shareholder reports adopting release at amendatory instruction 17.g. e. form n-csr we are amending items 2, 16, and 19 of form n-csr to correct outdated cross-references, remove unnecessary instructions, and redesignate the numbering of certain paragraphs. in the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation adopting release, the commission added a new item 18 (``recovery of erroneously awarded compensation'') to form n-csr and redesignated then-current item 18 (``exhibits'') as item 19.\\\\30\\\\ references in item 2 of form n-csr, however, erroneously still refer to item 18.\\\\31\\\\ we are therefore amending item 2 to refer to item 19 instead of item 18. \\\\30\\\\ listing standards for recovery of erroneously awarded compensation, investment company act release no. 34732 (october 26, 2022) [87 fr 73076 (november 28, 2022)] (``recovery of erroneously awarded compensation adopting release''), available at . \\\\31\\\\ these references appear in paragraphs (c) and (f) of item 2. in the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation adopting release, the commission also added new paragraph (a)(2) to newly designated item 19 (``exhibits'') and redesignated paragraph (a)(2) of newly redesignated item 19 as paragraph (a)(3). subsequent paragraphs were not renumbered, however, resulting in two paragraphs designated (a)(3). the amendments would correct this error by redesignating existing paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of newly redesignated item 19 as paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5). we are also correcting the title for the instructions to item 19, which currently erroneously references item 13. in addition, we are removing the instruction to paragraph (b) of item 16 and the instruction to paragraph (a)(3) of item 19 on form n- csr.\\\\32\\\\ these instructions were included in form n-csr pursuant to the 2016 investment company reporting modernization rulemaking to address how registrants should handle certain disclosures during the transition period before all registered management investment companies were required to file form n-port.\\\\33\\\\ these instructions are unnecessary as all registered management investment companies are currently required to file form n-port (i.e., the transition period for reporting on form n-port has concluded). \\\\32\\\\ see instruction to paragraph (b) of item 16 of form n-csr (``until the date that the registrant has filed its first report on form n-port (17 cfr 270.150), the registrant's disclosures required by this item are limited to any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.''); see also instruction to paragraph (a)(3) of item 19 on form n-csr (``until the date that the registrant has filed its first report on form n-port (17 cfr 270.150), in the certification required by item 18(a)(3), the registrant's certifying officers must certify that they have disclosed in the report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.''). \\\\33\\\\ see investment company reporting modernization, investment company act release no. 32314 (october 13, 2016) [81 fr 81870 (november 18, 2016)], available at . f. rule 204-2(j)(4) we are amending rule 204-2 under the investment advisers act to correct an erroneous cross reference. the corrected cross reference in rule 204-2(j)(4) will refer to 17 cfr 270.0-2(b)(2) (rule 0-2(b)(2)) for the definition of non-resident investment adviser (and not rule 0- 2(d)(3) under the investment advisers act, which does not exist). g. omb control numbers finally, we are amending 17 cfr 200.800 to display control numbers omb has assigned to certain existing information collection requirements pursuant to the paperwork reduction act that mistakenly were not previously listed in that rule. ii. procedural and other matters the administrative procedure act (``apa'') generally requires an agency to publish notice of a rulemaking in the federal register and provide an opportunity for public comment.\\\\34\\\\ this requirement does not apply, however, if the agency ``for good because, finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' \\\\35\\\\ given the nature of the amendments and the associated minimal exercise of discretion, the commission finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary and that there is good because to implement these amendments in a final rule. \\\\34\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 553(b)-(c). \\\\35\\\\ 5 you.s.c. 553(b)(3)(b). the amendments to form n-mfp correct inadvertent errors that created an inconsistency in the yield calculation formula and represented a departure from the longstanding method money market funds have used to calculate and report yield figures to the commission. the amendments to rule 482 conform the required risk disclosure to the recently amended regulatory framework for money market funds. the amendments to form n-1a, form n-2, form n-csr, and rule 204-2 are ministerial in nature. they update incorrect or outdated cross references, redesignate the numbering of certain paragraphs, or remove outdated information. accordingly, we find good because that publishing the amendments to form n-mfp, rule 482, form n-1a, form n-2, form n- csr, and rule 204-2 for comment is unnecessary. the apa also provides that notice of proposed rulemaking is not required for ``rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.'' \\\\36\\\\ the amendments to 17 cfr 200.800 pertain to agency organization, procedure, or practice, and therefore are not subject to the apa's requirement for advance notice and opportunity for public comment prior to publication. \\\\36\\\\ see 5 you.s.c. 553(b). the apa generally requires publication of a rule at least 30 days before its effective date. this requirement does not apply, however, if the agency finds good because for making the rule effective sooner.\\\\37\\\\ for the same reasons we are forgoing notice and comment, we find good because to make the amendments effective upon publication in the federal register. this finding that notice and public comment are unnecessary also satisfies the requirements of the congressional review act, allowing the amendments to become effective at such time that the commission determines.\\\\38\\\\ pursuant to the congressional review act, the office of information and regulatory affairs has designated these amendments not a ``major rule,'' as defined by 5 you.s.c. 804(2). the amendments also do not require analysis under the regulatory flexibility act.\\\\39\\\\ \\\\37\\\\ see 5 you.s.c. 553(d). \\\\38\\\\ see 5 you.s.c. 808(2), allowing the rule amendments to become effective notwithstanding the requirement of 5 you.s.c. 801 (if a federal agency finds that notice and public comment are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, a rule shall take effect at such time as the federal agency promulgating the rule determines). \\\\39\\\\ see 5 you.s.c. 604(a) (requiring a final regulatory flexibility analysis only for rules required by the apa or other law to undergo notice and comment). iii. economic analysis as discussed above, these amendments correct errors in certain commission rules and forms. the commission is mindful of the economic effects, including the benefits and costs, of the adopted amendments. the analysis below addresses the likely economic effects of the amendments, including the anticipated and estimated benefits and costs of the amendments and their likely effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.\\\\40\\\\ we analyze these effects against a baseline that consists of the current regulatory framework and current market practices. \\\\40\\\\ section 2(a) of the securities act, section 3(f) of the exchange act, section 2(c) of the investment company act, and section 202(c) of the investment advisers act require us, when engaging in rulemaking that requires us to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in or consistent with the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. section 23(a)(2) of the exchange act also requires us to consider the effect that the rules will have on competition and prohibits us from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the exchange act. the amendments we are adopting are limited in nature.\\\\41\\\\ therefore, many of the economic effects will be minimal or null. where we are unable to quantify those economic effects that may exist, we explain why they are impracticable to quantify and we discuss them in qualitative terms. given the nature of the benefits and the minimal costs expected to result from these amendments, we do not anticipate any changes to efficiency, competition, or capital formation will result from these amendments. \\\\41\\\\ see supra section ii. a. form n-mfp baseline. money market funds report their gross and net yields using public form n-mfp filings.\\\\42\\\\ the instructions accompanying these yields' calculations were inadvertently changed in a 2023 rulemaking.\\\\43\\\\ the amendments to form n-mfp correct this error.\\\\44\\\\ \\\\42\\\\ see form n-mfp item a.19 for instructions on the calculation of 7-day gross yields at the series level, and item b.8 for instructions on the calculation of 7-day net yields at the class level. \\\\43\\\\ the change directed the yield calculations to be based on the 7 business days preceding the date for which the yield is reported, instead of the 7 calendar days ended on (and including) that date. see supra section i.a. \\\\44\\\\ see supra section i. we estimate that this amendment to form n-mfp will apply to 291 money market funds registered with the commission as of december 31, 2023. commission staff have not observed evidence of reported yield changes that would be expected if money market funds had fully implemented the erroneous instructions in their calculations of 7-day annualized gross and net yields.\\\\45\\\\ \\\\45\\\\ the scaling factor of 3657 provided in the instructions to item a.19 and b.8 (by reference to item 26(a)(1) of form n-1a) appropriately annualizes yields calculated over a period of 7 calendar days, but is inconsistent with the longer period of 7 business days as erroneously amended. specifically, because 7 business days encompasses a longer period than 7 calendar days, a fund that annualizes its yields using a scaling factor of 3657 would overstate its annual yields relative to those yields reported prior to the june 11, 2024, compliance date. commission staff reviewed form n-mfp filings from 29 money market funds that filed form n-mfp in may 2024 (representing 10% of money market funds and $620 billion (9.5%) of money market fund net assets) and did not observe any evidence of any such changes in yield reporting following this compliance date. economic effects. the amendments to form n-mfp will correct errors and ensure that form n-mfp continues to reflect the longstanding calculation method for money market fund yields, including consistency in calculation methods across form n-mfp, prospectuses, advertisements, and sales literature.\\\\46\\\\ investors will benefit to the extent that they would have been confused as to the performance of any money market funds that incorporate the errors into their yield calculations.\\\\47\\\\ the change may also provide a small benefit to money market funds to the extent that the erroneous instructions and departure from longstanding methods would otherwise complicate their completion of the form. \\\\46\\\\ see supra footnote 17. \\\\47\\\\ see supra footnote 45 (explaining why applying the incorrect formula could create misleading yield results). we expect that money market funds will not incur significant costs associated with these amendments. as mentioned above, a review of a sample of form n-mfp filings suggests that filers' recent yield calculations do not reflect the error.\\\\48\\\\ if there are any money market funds that have implemented the erroneous instructions, those funds will have to make corrections to their internal processes following these amendments. however, we anticipate the one-time costs to do so will be minimal as funds are familiar with the correct method from form n-mfp prior to the erroneous amendments going into effect, as well as from preparing their prospectuses, advertisements, and sales literature. \\\\48\\\\ see supra section i.a. see also supra footnote 45. b. rule 482(b)(4) baseline. advertisements and other sales material for securities of a registered investment company that holds itself out to be a money market fund must include certain risk disclosures specified in paragraph (b)(4) of rule 482, as applicable to the fund.\\\\49\\\\ currently, the disclosures required by rule 482(b)(4) do not reflect recent changes to 17 cfr 270.2a-7 (rule 2a-7).\\\\50\\\\ in addition, the required wording in these disclosures deviates from the corresponding statements that form n-1a directs money market funds to include in their prospectuses, which historically had been aligned.\\\\51\\\\ the amendment to rule 482 corrects these errors by aligning the risk disclosure language in paragraph (b)(4) to exactly match the corresponding language in form n-1a.\\\\52\\\\ \\\\49\\\\ the amendment will update risk statement language that also applies to sales literature under rule 34b-1. see supra footnote 18. \\\\50\\\\ specifically, rule 482(b)(4) refers to a fund's suspension of redemptions or assessment of fees contingent upon the fund's available liquidity and regulatory minimums. these references are no longer applicable following the money market fund reform adopting release. the rule also includes outdated cross references to rule 2a-7. see supra footnote 23. \\\\51\\\\ see supra footnote 22 (describing corresponding statements). \\\\52\\\\ see supra section i.b. we estimate that the amendment to rule 482 will apply to 291 money market funds registered with the commission as of december 2023. money market funds will have to update their processes for preparing advertisements to incorporate the amended language in rule 482(b)(4), to the extent these processes have not already been updated. intermediaries that prepare money market fund advertisements are also subject to rule 482(b)(4) and will also have to update their processes, if they have not already done so. economic effects. the amendment will restore the consistency of the aforementioned risk disclosures presented by money market funds across various channels. this change will principally benefit certain prospective investors that may use a fund's advertisement to inform their investment decisions. specifically, these investors will be presented with information that accurately describes certain requirements of amended rule 2a-7 applicable to the fund, thereby eliminating any confusion stemming from potential inconsistencies in risk disclosures across these channels. funds and intermediaries will incur a minimal cost associated with updating their processes for preparing money market fund advertisements as a result of this amendment because the wording changes are not extensive, and they may take up to 90 days to make the changes. in addition, we anticipate that funds or intermediaries generally will update any previously prepared advertisements that are actively in use, but that have not been updated to account for amended rule 2a-7.\\\\53\\\\ this cost will scale with the number of these money market fund advertisements maintained by a fund or intermediary, but we expect the costs to funds and intermediaries will be minimal because the wording changes are minor and precisely prescribed, and funds and intermediaries may take up to 90 days to make the changes. \\\\53\\\\ pursuant to the paperwork reduction act analysis, we anticipate a one-time internal time burden of half an hour per fund, at a cost of $21,243 across 291 money market funds. see infra section iv. c. other amendments the amendments make several ministerial changes to correct missing or erroneous paragraph numbers, cross-references, and similar administrative text. these changes affect form n-1a, form n-csr, form n-2, rule 204-2(j)(4), and the omb control numbers listed in 17 cfr 200.800. form n-1a contains inaccurate language, in item 10(a)(1)(iii), about the location of a discussion regarding the basis for the fund board's approval of the fund's advisory contract: it states the basis will be in the fund's annual or semi-annual report to fund shareholders, but funds are required to include this basis in form n- csr filings rather than in reports.\\\\54\\\\ open-end funds use form n-1a to register with the commission and to offer their shares; as of december 2023, there are 12,153 open-end funds registered with the commission. \\\\54\\\\ see supra section i.c. correcting the erroneous statement in form n-1a may benefit certain prospective investors that are inclined to review a fund board's basis for approving the fund's advisory contract. we are unaware of any data that would allow us to estimate the number of prospective investors that are inclined to seek out this information or the number of these prospective investors that would face difficulty obtaining this information in the absence of the technical amendment. however, any benefit will be small because investors can find this information despite the error.\\\\55\\\\ similarly, the costs that funds will undertake to update the wording on form n-1a to reference form n-csr rather than their annual or semi-annual report will be minimal because the wording changes are not extensive and because funds will not need to include the updated language until their next annual prospectus update following the adoption of the amendments to form n-1a.\\\\56\\\\ \\\\55\\\\ see supra footnote 28 and accompanying text. \\\\56\\\\ see id. and accompanying text. form n-csr contains incorrect cross-references, paragraph numbering, and section headings.\\\\57\\\\ as of december 2023, there are 12,851 registered management investment companies that are registered with the commission and required to file form n-csr. correcting form n- csr will benefit users to the extent they may have been confused by the errors. registered management investment companies will not incur any costs as a result of the corrections, which impose no new obligations. \\\\57\\\\ item 2 and item 19 of form n-csr contain incorrect cross- references. in addition, certain paragraphs in item 19 are incorrectly numbered and one of the headings incorrectly refers to item 13 instead of item 19. also, instructions to item 16(b) and item(a)(3) are irrelevant, as they refer to a 2016 rulemaking's pre- compliance transitionary period that is now concluded. see supra section i.e. form n-2 contains an incorrect cross-reference.\\\\58\\\\ closed-end funds use form n-2 to register with the commission and to offer their shares; as of december 2023 there are 683 closed-end funds registered with the commission. there may be a minimal benefit to closed-end funds resulting from this change if fewer compliance resources are required to correctly complete the form. there will be no cost to closed-end funds or other registrants, as the change does not require any action. \\\\58\\\\ instruction 8.a to item 24 of form n-2 refers to item 7 of form n-csr; it should instead refer to item 12. see supra section i.d. rule 204-2(j)(4) contains an incorrect cross-reference. rule 204- 2(j)(4) sets books and records requirements for non-resident advisers; as of december 2023, there are 15,478 advisers registered with the commission. there may be minimal benefit to advisers from this amendment to the extent that the erroneous cross reference caused confusion to some registrants or other individuals.\\\\59\\\\ there will be no costs to advisers or other registrants resulting from this change, as no new actions will be required of them. \\\\59\\\\ rule 204-2(j)(4) incorrectly cross-references the location of the definition of ``non-resident advisers.'' the erroneous reference does not exist, and the definition appears in the same section as the erroneous reference, so any confusion is likely small. see supra section i.f. the table in 17 cfr 200.800 displays current omb control numbers for information collection requirements codified in title 17 of the cfr, but omb control numbers for several rules are absent from this display.\\\\60\\\\ this amendment may benefit the public to the extent the corrected table improves ease of reference. we expect any benefit to be small. the amendment has no costs to registrants or other market participants. \\\\60\\\\ see supra section i.g. iv. paperwork reduction act certain provisions of the rules and form amendments contain ``collection of information'' requirements within the meaning of the paperwork reduction act of 1995 (``pra'').\\\\61\\\\ specifically, the amendments to rule 482(b)(4) of the securities act to revise the particular wording of the risk statements that money market funds must include in their advertisements modify an existing ``collection of information.'' the title for the existing collection of information is ``rule 482 under the securities act of 1933, advertising by an investment company as satisfying requirements of section 10'' (omb control no. 3235-0565). this collection of information will be mandatory for money market funds and the information will not be kept confidential. an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid omb control number. we are submitting the proposed collections of information to the office of management and budget for review in accordance with the pra. \\\\61\\\\ 44 you.s.c. 3501 et seq. in our most recent pra submission for rule 482, we estimated the annual aggregate burden to comply with the collection of information requirement of rule 482 is 577,847 burden hours with an internal cost burden of $213,133,255.\\\\62\\\\ given that the amendments are one-time updates to the wording of the risk statements already required under current rule 482(b)(4), we believe that, once affected funds have made these one-time changes, the amendments to rule 482(b)(4) will only require money market funds to incur the same costs and hour burdens, per fund, on an ongoing basis as under current rule 482(b)(4). \\\\62\\\\ the most recent rule 482 pra submission was approved in 2022 (omb control no. 3235-0565). the table below summarizes our pra initial and ongoing annual burden estimates associated with the amendments to rule 482. some money market funds may have already updated the risk statements in their advertisements to conform with the required risk statements in their prospectus. accordingly, the pra estimates likely overestimate the costs associated with the final amendments for those funds whose risk statements in their advertisements are currently in line with the risk statements that the amendments would require. estimates internal initial internal annual internal time burden hours burden hours \\\\1\\\\ wage rate \\\\2\\\\ costs

estimated wage figures are based on published rates for the professionals described in this chart, modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and inflation. the estimated figures for the proposed burdens were multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. see securities industry and financial markets association's report on management & professional earnings in the securities industry 2013. \\\\3\\\\ this estimate assumes that, after the initial 0.5 hours to amend the fund's risk statement, funds would not have an ongoing burden associated with the amendment. \\\\4\\\\ this represents a blended rate for a compliance attorney ($449) and a senior programmer ($408). \\\\5\\\\ the number of funds estimate is based on the number of money market funds reporting to the commission on form n-mfp as of december 2023. the amendments to form n-mfp, form n-1a, form n-2, form n-csr, and rule 204-2 do not make any substantive modifications to any existing collection of information requirements or impose any new substantive recordkeeping or information collection requirements within the meaning of the pra.\\\\63\\\\ accordingly, we are not revising any burden and cost estimates in connection with these amendments. \\\\63\\\\ see supra footnote 45 and accompanying text (stating that commission staff review of a recent sample of form n-mfp filings suggests that filers' yield calculations do not reflect the error in the money market fund reform adopting release). see also supra section i.c (stating that funds may implement the

(ii) an advertisement for an investment company that holds itself out to be a money market fund, that is a government money market fund, as defined in sec. 270.2a-7(a)(14) of this chapter, or a retail money market fund, as defined in sec. 270.2a-7(a)(21) of this chapter, and that is subject to the requirements of sec. 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) of this chapter (or is not subject to the requirements of sec. 270.2a- 7(c)(2)(i) of this chapter pursuant to sec. 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i)(b) of this chapter, but has chosen to rely on the ability to impose liquidity fees consistent with the requirements of sec. 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i)), must include the following statement: you could lose money by investing in the fund. although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. the fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares. an investment in the fund is not a bank account and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency. the fund's sponsor is not required to reimburse the fund for losses, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time, including during periods of market stress. (iii) an advertisement for an investment company that holds itself out to be a money market fund, that is a government money market fund, as defined in sec. 270.2a-7(a)(14) of this chapter, that is not subject to the requirements of sec. 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) of this chapter pursuant to sec. 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i)(b) of this chapter, and that has not chosen to rely on the ability to impose liquidity fees consistent with the requirements of sec. 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i), must include the following statement: you could lose money by investing in the fund. although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. an investment in the fund is not a bank account and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency. the fund's sponsor is not required to reimburse the fund for losses, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time, including during periods of market stress. note 3 to paragraph (b)(4). if an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of the fund, or an affiliated person of such a person, has contractually committed to provide financial support to the fund, the statement may omit the last sentence (``the fund's sponsor is not required to reimburse the fund for losses, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time, including during periods of market stress.'') for the term of the agreement. for purposes of this note, the term ``financial support'' includes any capital contribution, purchase of a security from the fund in reliance on sec. 270.17a-9 of this chapter, purchase of any defaulted or devalued security at par, execution of letter of credit or letter of indemnity, capital support agreement (whether or not the fund ultimately received support), performance guarantee, or any other similar action reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund's portfolio; however, the term ``financial support'' excludes any routine waiver of fees or reimbursement of fund expenses, routine inter-fund lending, routine inter-fund purchases of fund shares, or any action that would qualify as financial support as defined in this note, that the board of directors has otherwise determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund's portfolio.part 274forms prescribed under the investment company act of 1940 0 5. the authority citation for part 274 continues to read as follows: authority: 15 you.s.c. 77f, 77g, 77h, 77j, 77s, 78c(b), 78l, 78m, 78n, 78n-1, 78o(d), 80a-8, 80a-24, 80a-26, 80a-29, and sec. 939a, pub. l. 111-203, 124 stat. 1376, unless otherwise noted. 0 6. amend form n-1a (referenced in sec. sec. 239.15a and 274.11a) by revising item 10. note: form n-1a is attached as appendix a to this document. form n-1a will not appear in the code of federal regulations. 0 7. amend form n-2 (referenced in sec. sec. 239.14 and 274.11a-1) by revising instruction 8.a to item 24. note: form n-2 is attached as appendix b to this document. form n-2 will not appear in the code of federal regulations. 0 8. revise form n-csr (referenced in sec. sec. 249.331 and 274.128) by: 0 a. in items 2(c) and (f), removing the text ``item 18(a)(1)'' and adding, in its place, the text ``item 19(a)(1)'';

act, 2020, public law 116-94, 133 stat. 2534, 3226, amended section 7508a of the code, relating to the discretionary authority of the secretary of the treasury or her delegate (secretary) to postpone certain time-sensitive tax deadlines by reason of a federally declared disaster, by adding section 7508a(d). this provision provides qualified taxpayers a mandatory 60-day period that is to be disregarded ``in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' on january 13, 2021, the irs published in the federal register a notice of proposed rulemaking (reg-115057-20, 86 fr 2607) to interpret and implement sections 165(i)(5) and 7508a(d). five responsive written comments were received. no commenter requested a public hearing, so none was held. as described more fully in the preamble to the proposed regulations, section 7508a(d) is ambiguous in at least two important respectsthe time-sensitive acts to be postponed (beyond the pension- related actions described in section 7508a(d)(4)) are not specified and it is unclear how the mandatory 60-day postponement period is to be calculated when the disaster declaration specified in section 7508a(d) does not contain an incident date. the legislative history is also insufficient to explain these areas of ambiguity. these final regulations amend the procedure and administration regulations (26 cfr part 301) under section 7508a and the income tax regulations (26 cfr part 1) under section 165 to clarify the definition of the term ``federally declared disaster.'' as described further below, the department of the treasury (treasury department) and the irs have modified proposed sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii), example (3), in these final regulations to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period and to correct typographical errors. no other changes have been adopted. comments on the proposed regulations section 1.165-11(b)(1) the proposed regulations provided that a federally declared disaster includes both a major disaster and an emergency declared under sections 401 or 501, respectively, of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (stafford act), public law 100- 707,102 stat. 4689 (1988). one commenter said it approved of the proposed regulations including emergency declarations in the definition of a federally declared disaster under section 165(i)(5)(a). however, another commenter was critical of this portion of the proposed regulations and recommended that it be stricken. this second commenter said emergency declarations are governed by a different set of rules than major disaster declarations, pointing out that emergency declarations (i) do not need to be preceded by a governor's request for stafford act relief (but may instead be declared sua sponte by the president), (ii) may only result (if not followed up by a major disaster declaration) in federal assistance to local governmental entities (as opposed to assistance to individuals), and (iii) may be issued before a disaster. this commenter further opined that president trump's letter of march 13, 2020, declaring an emergency under the stafford act with respect to the covid-19 pandemic, was not authorized by congress to serve as a disaster declaration under sections 165(i)(5)(a) and 7508a of the code. the comment from the second commenter is not adopted in the final regulations. in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part iii. federally declared disasters, this issue is already addressed in detail. there is no provision in the stafford act to declare a ``disaster.'' the legislative history of the stafford act indicates that the term ``disaster'' is an umbrella term that includes both an emergency and a major disaster. the conference report to the disaster relief and emergency assistance act of 1974, public law 93-288, 88 stat. 143 (1974), clarified the definitional section of the stafford act, stating: ``it was the intention of the conferees not to define the term `disaster' specifically; whenever used in this legislation such term includes an emergency or a major disaster.'' h.r. rep. 93-1037, p. 26 (may 13, 1974). the opening section of the stafford act, titled ``congressional findings and declarations,'' uses the generic term ``disaster'' in laying out the key congressional findings and declarations that underlie the rest of the chapter's provisions. stafford act section 101(a), 42 you.s.c. 5121(a). in multiple revenue rulings, the irs has provided that, for the purposes of section 165(i), a federally declared disaster includes an emergency or a major disaster declared under the stafford act. several of these revenue rulings are cited in the preamble to the proposed regulations. the differences noted by the commenter between emergencies and major disasters under the stafford act are not material to their treatment under sections 165(i)(5)(a) and 7508a of the code. most disaster declarations announced by the federal emergency management agency (fema) for particular states also provide only public assistance, and no individual assistance, to particular counties in the state under the stafford act. in addition, most emergency declarations announced by fema are under section 501(a) of the stafford act, and begin with a request from a governor or other chief executive of a state, territory, or tribal government. as noted in the preamble to the proposed regulations, it is rare for an emergency declaration to be made without such a request. the president is authorized to make an emergency declaration under section 501(b) of the stafford act when the united states will have the primary responsibility for response to the emergency. there is no difference in the need for affected persons in a state threatened with a disaster to receive relief from time-sensitive deadlines to perform specified acts under the code when the request for such relief originates with the state's governor or is independently raised by the president. consequently, the final regulations make no changes to this portion of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(1)-(2) the proposed regulations provided that (excluding the pension- related acts described in section 7508a(d)(4)) the time-sensitive tax acts that are postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period are the acts, if any, that the secretary determines to be postponed under section 7508a(a) or (b). one commenter expressed a general concern that this provision had the potential to reduce section 7508a(d) to a nullity. a second commenter expressed its concerns specifically in terms of what it contended was a clear reading of the statute and its legislative history. this commenter said it was clear that congress intended to postpone the timely performance of all of the time-sensitive tax acts, both taxpayer and government acts, listed in section 7508(a)(1) of the code. however, this second commenter recommended that the final regulations provide that the government may take advantage of the postponement periods for government-initiated actions only if a taxpayer first acts in reliance on the ``automatic'' postponement periods for the taxpayer's time-sensitive tax acts. a third commenter agreed with the secretary's characterizations of the statute and legislative history as ambiguous on the issues of which time-sensitive tax acts (other than the pension-related tax acts described in section 7508a(d)(4)) are postponed under section 7508a(d) and of which declared disasters are subject to the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d). this commenter approved of the solution to these ambiguities that was reflected in the proposed regulations, in terms of which time-sensitive tax acts would be postponed. this commenter said section 7508a(d) was a poorly-worded statute, that the legislative history of the provisions contained contradictions, and the result was that section 7508a(d)(1) leaves no (non-pension) time-sensitive tax acts for section 7508a(d) to operate upon, unless or until the secretary exercises her powers under section 7508a(a). the third commenter noted also that for the year 2017, the irs provided relief under section 7508a(a) in response to only 14 of the 59 major disaster declarations announced by fema that year. if all major disaster declarations automatically entitled all taxpayers in disaster areas to timing relief under section 7508a(d), the commenter noted that there would be a dramatic increase in the number of disasters leading to postponements of time-sensitive tax acts. on these issues, the third commenter concluded that the proposed regulations properly preserved the discretion of the irs to determine which declared disasters should result in any type of disaster relief and of which time-sensitive tax acts should be postponed under section 7508a. the comments from the first two commenters on this issue are not adopted in the final regulations, while the approving comments of the third commenter were already reflected in the proposed regulations. as explained more fully in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part i. time-sensitive tax acts, and as noted by the third commenter described above, except for the rules regarding pensions described in section 7508a(d)(4), section 7508a(d), by its terms, does not specify the time-sensitive tax acts to be postponed during the mandatory 60-day postponement period. instead, section 7508a(d)(1) provides that the mandatory 60-day postponement period ``shall be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' section 7508a(a) is not self-executing, but rather, requires a determination by the secretary to specify the acts to be postponed. as a result, the cross-reference to section 7508a(a) in section 7508a(d)(1) operates to require the same determination by the secretary as a prerequisite to determining the acts to which the mandatory 60-day postponement period applies. this interpretation gives full effect to the statutory language and does not reduce section 7508a(d) to a nullity, because that section still imposes a mandatory period for postponement and establishes a new category of persons eligible for reliefthe ``qualified taxpayers'' defined in section 7508a(d)(2). the final regulations make no changes to sec. 301.7508a- 1(g)(1) and (2) of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i) section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i) of the proposed regulations tracked section 7508a(d)(1) and (d)(5) in describing how the mandatory 60-day postponement period for federally declared disasters will be calculated and how the calculation of that mandatory postponement period will interact with the secretary's discretionary postponement period (if any) under section 7508a(a) and (b). the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part ii. calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period, identified a 120-day postponement period from the beginning incident date of a disaster announced by fema as the usual postponement period provided by the irs for those disasters where the irs exercises its discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) to postpone any time-sensitive tax acts. consequently, most mandatory 60-day postponement periods under section 7508a(d) will be calculated to run concurrently with the 120- day postponement period the irs generally provides under section 7508a(a) or (b). two commenters noted that section 7508a(d)(1) and the proposed regulations did not provide a clear rule for calculating the mandatory 60-day postponement period when there was more than one disaster declaration issued for the same disaster in a particular state or when any disaster declaration was amended to provide any new or modified incident dates (earliest or latest) that were missing or different from when the first disaster declaration for a disaster in a state was announced by fema. two commenters suggested potential alternative methods of making calculations of the mandatory 60-day postponement period more certain when there are multiple disaster declarations or disaster declarations that are amended by fema for the earliest or latest incident dates described in section 7508a(d)(1)(a) and (b). one commenter claimed that a literal reading of section 7508a(d)(1) creates challenges for indefinite disasters, such as the covid-19 pandemic, because the statute could be interpreted to postpone a taxpayer's deadlines ``indefinitely until some unknown point in time that is long after the disaster began.'' to avoid this ``unworkable application'' of the statute, this commenter recommended that if the initial disaster declaration does not expressly identify the latest incident date for a disaster, then section 7508a(d) should be interpreted as automatically providing a postponement period until the date that is 60 days after the earliest incident date specified in a disaster declaration. however, the statute mitigates the commenter's concern by directing that the postponement period under section 7508a(d) ``shall be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under subsection (a).'' that provision ensures that the secretary retains the same discretion as she has under section 7508a(a) to determine what time-sensitive tax acts, if any, will be postponed. a second commenter noted what it characterized as a pick-and-choose problem and an amendment problem with the method of calculating the mandatory 60-day postponement period provided for in the proposed regulations and recommended the secretary adopt one of several alternative bright-line rules it suggested for making the calculation period more predictable. this second commenter noted there was a potential pick-and-choose problem among multiple potential fema-announced disaster declarations, because the treasury department and the irs propose to treat fema- announced emergency declarations (as well as major disaster declarations) under the stafford act as federally declared disasters under sections 165 and 7508a of the code. this commenter's recommendation to strike proposed amended regulation sec. 1.165- 11(b)(1) is discussed and rejected in the preamble discussion of this issue above. alternatively, the second commenter recommended that the final regulations reflect a bright-line rule to address potential multiple declarations, such as a first-out rule (the first issued declaration controls), a rule that a later major disaster declaration controls over an earlier emergency declaration, or a rule that the issue date of an emergency declaration is the earliest incident date for section 7508a(d)(1)'s mandatory 60-day postponement period. the second commenter further recommended in this section of the final regulations that the treasury department and the irs provide a bright-line rule concerning the effect of potential amendments to an initial fema announced disaster declaration on how the mandatory 60-day postponement period is calculated. the additional potential bright-line alternatives suggested by the second commenter were that (i) future amendments will not affect how the mandatory period is calculated, or (ii) only amendments made within a certain amount of time (say one year) will affect the computation of the mandatory period. the treasury department and the irs appreciate the predictability offered by the bright-line rules suggested by the second commenter. nevertheless, the statutory language providing for a mandatory period beginning on the earliest incident date specified in the disaster declaration and ending on the date which is 60 days after the latest incident date so specified is capable of being applied as written. while amendments to disaster declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates can cause confusion, the intent of the statute is to ensure that relief is provided throughout the disaster period, assuming such a period is identified in the disaster declaration and the secretary has determined that postponement of time-sensitive tax acts is warranted. as a result, the comment on this issue is not adopted in the final regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(ii)(a) the proposed regulations provided that in no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year. one commenter stated that this portion of the proposed regulations should be removed because it lacks any basis in the text or legislative history of section 7508a(d)(1) or (d)(4). the comment on this issue is not adopted in the final regulations. as stated in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part ii. calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period, it defies logic for the secretary's discretionary postponement period under section 7508a(a) to be limited to ``a period of up to 1 year,'' and there be no limit on the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d). interpreting section 7508a(d) to allow postponement periods for more than 1 year would be contrary to the directive of section 7508a(d)(1) that the mandatory 60- day postponement period must ``be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' the final regulations make no change to sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(ii)(a) of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii) example (3) the proposed regulations provided an example (3) concerning a continuing disaster declaration involving wildfires that was later amended by a subsequent fema announcement of a latest incident date for the disaster. this example contained typographical errors, including a misnumbering``(5)'' instead of ``(4)''of the subparagraph for the four examples and referring to the taxpayer in the example variously as ``individual c'' and ``individual d.'' one commenter further noted that the intended rules, if any, which example (3) was meant to illustrate were not described in the portions of the proposed regulations which precede the examples section. example (3) is intended to illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period in the event of an ongoing disaster with multiple declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates described in sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3) of these final regulations. the treasury department and the irs have modified example (3) in these final regulations, in consideration of the comment above as well as the comments received on sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i), to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period and to correct typographical errors. section 301.7508a-1(h)(2) the proposed regulations provided that the final regulations shall apply to all disasters declared on or after december 21, 2019. one commenter requested not only that the final regulations not be retroactive to the effective date of section 7508a(d), but that the final regulations provide relief to any individuals or employee benefit plans that took actions (or failed to take actions) based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the postponement relief provided in section 7508a. the commenter further requested that such good faith relief be available for at least 60 days after the final regulations are published in the federal register. the applicability date discussion in the preamble to the proposed regulations clearly indicated the intention of the treasury department and the irs to rely on the provisions of section 7805(b)(2) of the code for the applicability date of these final regulations. section 7805(b)(2) provides that regulations filed or issued within 18 months of the date of enactment of the statutory provision to which the regulations relate are not prohibited from applying retroactively to the date of enactment. section 7508a(d) was enacted on december 20, 2019, and these final regulations have been filed or issued within 18 months of that date of enactment. the proposed regulations were clear in stating that the treasury department and the irs intended for the final regulations to apply to any disasters that were declared on or after december 21, 2019. these final regulations do not adopt the commenter's request to modify sec. 301.7508a-1(h)(2) of the proposed regulations. new rule proposal one commenter requested that the final regulations ``confirm'' that all forms of deadline relief requested under section 7508a are optional for affected taxpayers. in particular, the commenter focused on deadlines arising under employee benefit plans. in some cases, the application of these deadlines may affect both the plan and the participants. after consideration, the treasury department and the irs have concluded that the suggestions made in this comment are beyond the intended scope of the proposed regulations. consequently, the suggestions are not adopted in these final regulations. modifications of proposed regulations section 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii) example (3) example (3) is modified to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period in the event of multiple declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates, and to correct typographical errors. applicability dates for date of applicability for the amendment to the procedure and administration regulations under section 7508a, see sec. 301.7508a- 1(h), which provides that the regulations promulgated by this treasury decision are applicable for federally declared disasters that are declared on or after december 21, 2019, as explained in the preamble to the proposed regulations (reg-115057-20) published in the federal register (86 fr 2607), because section 7805(b)(2) of the internal revenue code (code) provides that regulations filed or issued within 18 months of the date of the enactment of the statutory provision to which they relate may apply to taxable periods prior to those described in section 7805(b)(1) and these final regulations are being published within 18 months of the enactment of section 7508a(d) on december 20, 2019. the date of applicability for the amendment to the income tax regulations under section 165 of the code to clarify the definition of the term ``federally declared disaster'' is june 11, 2021. special analyses certain irs regulations, including these, are exempt from the requirements of executive order 12866, as supplemented and affirmed by executive order 13563. therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. pursuant to the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6), it is hereby certified that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. the regulations clarify how the secretary may postpone certain time- sensitive tax deadlines by reason of a federally declared disaster. such postponements provide more time for affected taxpayers to complete time-sensitive acts than they otherwise would have under the internal revenue laws. in addition, the regulations do not impose a collection of information burden on any person, including small entities, for purposes of the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6). accordingly, the secretary certifies that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. pursuant to section 7805(f) of the internal revenue code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these final regulations was submitted to the chief counsel for advocacy of the small business administration for comments on its impact on small business, and no comments were received. drafting information the principal authors of these final regulations are andrew c. keaton and william v. spatz of the office of associate chief counsel (procedure and administration). however, other personnel from the treasury department and the irs participated in their development. list of subjects 26 cfr part 1 income taxes, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 26 cfr part 301 employment taxes,

provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to elections and revocations that are made on or after october 16, 2019. (2) paragraph (b)(1) of this section. the second sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to elections and revocations that are made on or after june 11, 2021. part 301procedure and administration 0 par. 3. the authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows: authority: 26 you.s.c. 78050 par. 4. section 301.7508a-1 is amended by revising paragraph (g) and adding paragraph (h) to read as follows: sec. 301.7508a-1 postponement of certain tax-related deadlines by reasons of a federally declared disaster or terroristic or military action.(g) mandatory 60-day postponement(1) in general. in addition to (or concurrent with) the postponement period specified by the secretary in an exercise of the authority under section 7508a(a) to postpone time-sensitive acts by reason of a federally declared disaster, qualified taxpayers (as defined in section 7508a(d)(2)) are entitled to a mandatory 60-day postponement period during which the time to perform those time-sensitive acts is disregarded in the same manner as under section 7508a(a). the rules of this paragraph (g)(1) apply with respect to a postponement period specified by the secretary under section 7508a(b), to postpone acts as provided in section 7508a(d)(4). except for the acts set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, section 7508a(d) does not apply to postpone any acts. (2) acts postponed. the time-sensitive acts that are postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period are the acts determined to be postponed by the secretary's exercise of authority under section 7508a(a) or (b). in addition, in the case of any person described in section 7508a(b), the time-sensitive acts postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period include those described in section 7508a(d)(4): (i) making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within the meaning of section 4974(c)) under section 219(f)(3), 404(a)(6), 404(h)(1)(b), or 404(m)(2); (ii) making distributions under section 408(d)(4); (iii) recharacterizing contributions under section 408a(d)(6); and (iv) making a rollover under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3). (3) calculation of mandatory 60-day postponement period(i) in general. the mandatory 60-day postponement period begins on the earliest incident date specified in a disaster declaration for a federally declared disaster and ends on the date that is 60 days after the latest incident date specified in the disaster declaration. in accordance with section 7508a(d)(5), the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d) runs concurrently with the postponement period determined by the secretary in exercising discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) if the period determined by the secretary is equal to or longer than 60 days after the latest incident date. if the period determined by the secretary in exercising discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) ends prior to 60 days after the latest incident date, in accordance with section 7508a(d)(5), the mandatory 60-day postponement period will run concurrently for the length of the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b) and then continue running in addition to the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b). (ii) limitations on the mandatory 60-day postponement period. (a) in no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year. (b) in the event the secretary determines to postpone time- sensitive acts pursuant to a declaration establishing a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508a that does not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508a(d). in such cases, the only postponement period will be the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b). (4) examples. the rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples: (i) example (1). individual a lives in a state that experienced severe but isolated tornado damage on march 15. on march 20, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president for the state where individual a lives, describing the incident date for the tornado as march 15. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs published a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from march 15 through july 31, pursuant to section 7508a(a). the county where individual a lives was included in the news release. under section 7508a(d), the mandatory 60-day postponement period that individual a is entitled to begins on march 15 and ends 60 days after march 15, on may 14. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual a under section 7508a(a). (ii) example (2). individual b lives in a coastal state which experienced harmful effects from a hurricane that began to affect the weather in his state on august 15 and ceased to be a weather factor in his state on august 19. on august 22, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president, determining that the coastline counties in the state, including the county where individual b lives, were severely affected and that these counties were entitled to both individual assistance and public assistance. the major disaster declaration specified the earliest incident date for the hurricane in the state where individual b lives as august 15 and the latest incident date as august 19. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs published a news release identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from august 15 through december 31, pursuant to section 7508a(a). under section 7508a(d), the mandatory 60- day postponement period that individual b is entitled to begins on august 15 and ends 60 days after august 19, on october 18. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual b under section 7508a(a). (iii) example (3). individual c lives in a county of a state that is experiencing ongoing wildfires. on august 14, fema issued a federal register notice announcing an emergency declaration approved by the president to make public assistance available under the stafford act to local governments to fight the wildfires. this declaration specified an earliest incident date of august 14 and no latest incident date. on august 17, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president for the same wildfires incident, announcing that the residents of the county where individual c lives were eligible to receive individual assistance under the stafford act. this declaration specified august 15 as the earliest incident date and described the incident period as ongoing. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs exercised its discretion under section 7508a(a) to publish a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the wildfires disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying both the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from august 15 through december 15. following the initial news release, the wildfires disaster remained ongoing, with no ending incident date specified, for several months. the irs published a second news release postponing the time-sensitive acts through january 15. fema subsequently amended the major disaster declaration to specify the latest incident date of november 19. because the irs acted in its discretion to provide relief in response to the major disaster declaration, and not to provide relief in response to the emergency declaration, the mandatory 60-day postponement period that individual c is entitled to under section 7508a(d) begins on august 15, the earliest incident date specified in the major disaster declaration, and ends 60 days after the latest incident date of november 19. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual c under section 7508a(a), and ends on january 18, which is 60 days after the latest incident date and three days beyond the postponement period specified by the irs under section 7508a(a) in its news release. (iv) example (4). individual d lives in the united states, which is experiencing a nationwide emergency as a result of its residents being exposed to a highly infectious and dangerous pandemic disease. on march 13, the president declared a nationwide emergency under section 501(b) of the stafford act. the pandemic became a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508a on march 13, however, no incident date was specified in the president's emergency declaration. pursuant to the president's march 13 emergency declaration, the irs published several notices identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement that generally ran from april 1 through july 15, pursuant to section 7508a(a). because, in this circumstance, the emergency declaration pursuant to which the notices were published did not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508a(d). the only postponement period is the period determined by the secretary pursuant to the discretionary authority under section 7508a(a). (h) applicability dates(1) in general. except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to disasters declared after january 15, 2009.

act, 2020, public law 116-94, 133 stat. 2534, 3226, amended section 7508a of the code, relating to the discretionary authority of the secretary of the treasury or her delegate (secretary) to postpone certain time-sensitive tax deadlines by reason of a federally declared disaster, by adding section 7508a(d). this provision provides qualified taxpayers a mandatory 60-day period that is to be disregarded ``in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' on january 13, 2021, the irs published in the federal register a notice of proposed rulemaking (reg-115057-20, 86 fr 2607) to interpret and implement sections 165(i)(5) and 7508a(d). five responsive written comments were received. no commenter requested a public hearing, so none was held. as described more fully in the preamble to the proposed regulations, section 7508a(d) is ambiguous in at least two important respectsthe time-sensitive acts to be postponed (beyond the pension- related actions described in section 7508a(d)(4)) are not specified and it is unclear how the mandatory 60-day postponement period is to be calculated when the disaster declaration specified in section 7508a(d) does not contain an incident date. the legislative history is also insufficient to explain these areas of ambiguity. these final regulations amend the procedure and administration regulations (26 cfr part 301) under section 7508a and the income tax regulations (26 cfr part 1) under section 165 to clarify the definition of the term ``federally declared disaster.'' as described further below, the department of the treasury (treasury department) and the irs have modified proposed sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii), example (3), in these final regulations to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period and to correct typographical errors. no other changes have been adopted. comments on the proposed regulations section 1.165-11(b)(1) the proposed regulations provided that a federally declared disaster includes both a major disaster and an emergency declared under sections 401 or 501, respectively, of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (stafford act), public law 100- 707,102 stat. 4689 (1988). one commenter said it approved of the proposed regulations including emergency declarations in the definition of a federally declared disaster under section 165(i)(5)(a). however, another commenter was critical of this portion of the proposed regulations and recommended that it be stricken. this second commenter said emergency declarations are governed by a different set of rules than major disaster declarations, pointing out that emergency declarations (i) do not need to be preceded by a governor's request for stafford act relief (but may instead be declared sua sponte by the president), (ii) may only result (if not followed up by a major disaster declaration) in federal assistance to local governmental entities (as opposed to assistance to individuals), and (iii) may be issued before a disaster. this commenter further opined that president trump's letter of march 13, 2020, declaring an emergency under the stafford act with respect to the covid-19 pandemic, was not authorized by congress to serve as a disaster declaration under sections 165(i)(5)(a) and 7508a of the code. the comment from the second commenter is not adopted in the final regulations. in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part iii. federally declared disasters, this issue is already addressed in detail. there is no provision in the stafford act to declare a ``disaster.'' the legislative history of the stafford act indicates that the term ``disaster'' is an umbrella term that includes both an emergency and a major disaster. the conference report to the disaster relief and emergency assistance act of 1974, public law 93-288, 88 stat. 143 (1974), clarified the definitional section of the stafford act, stating: ``it was the intention of the conferees not to define the term `disaster' specifically; whenever used in this legislation such term includes an emergency or a major disaster.'' h.r. rep. 93-1037, p. 26 (may 13, 1974). the opening section of the stafford act, titled ``congressional findings and declarations,'' uses the generic term ``disaster'' in laying out the key congressional findings and declarations that underlie the rest of the chapter's provisions. stafford act section 101(a), 42 you.s.c. 5121(a). in multiple revenue rulings, the irs has provided that, for the purposes of section 165(i), a federally declared disaster includes an emergency or a major disaster declared under the stafford act. several of these revenue rulings are cited in the preamble to the proposed regulations. the differences noted by the commenter between emergencies and major disasters under the stafford act are not material to their treatment under sections 165(i)(5)(a) and 7508a of the code. most disaster declarations announced by the federal emergency management agency (fema) for particular states also provide only public assistance, and no individual assistance, to particular counties in the state under the stafford act. in addition, most emergency declarations announced by fema are under section 501(a) of the stafford act, and begin with a request from a governor or other chief executive of a state, territory, or tribal government. as noted in the preamble to the proposed regulations, it is rare for an emergency declaration to be made without such a request. the president is authorized to make an emergency declaration under section 501(b) of the stafford act when the united states will have the primary responsibility for response to the emergency. there is no difference in the need for affected persons in a state threatened with a disaster to receive relief from time-sensitive deadlines to perform specified acts under the code when the request for such relief originates with the state's governor or is independently raised by the president. consequently, the final regulations make no changes to this portion of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(1)-(2) the proposed regulations provided that (excluding the pension- related acts described in section 7508a(d)(4)) the time-sensitive tax acts that are postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period are the acts, if any, that the secretary determines to be postponed under section 7508a(a) or (b). one commenter expressed a general concern that this provision had the potential to reduce section 7508a(d) to a nullity. a second commenter expressed its concerns specifically in terms of what it contended was a clear reading of the statute and its legislative history. this commenter said it was clear that congress intended to postpone the timely performance of all of the time-sensitive tax acts, both taxpayer and government acts, listed in section 7508(a)(1) of the code. however, this second commenter recommended that the final regulations provide that the government may take advantage of the postponement periods for government-initiated actions only if a taxpayer first acts in reliance on the ``automatic'' postponement periods for the taxpayer's time-sensitive tax acts. a third commenter agreed with the secretary's characterizations of the statute and legislative history as ambiguous on the issues of which time-sensitive tax acts (other than the pension-related tax acts described in section 7508a(d)(4)) are postponed under section 7508a(d) and of which declared disasters are subject to the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d). this commenter approved of the solution to these ambiguities that was reflected in the proposed regulations, in terms of which time-sensitive tax acts would be postponed. this commenter said section 7508a(d) was a poorly-worded statute, that the legislative history of the provisions contained contradictions, and the result was that section 7508a(d)(1) leaves no (non-pension) time-sensitive tax acts for section 7508a(d) to operate upon, unless or until the secretary exercises her powers under section 7508a(a). the third commenter noted also that for the year 2017, the irs provided relief under section 7508a(a) in response to only 14 of the 59 major disaster declarations announced by fema that year. if all major disaster declarations automatically entitled all taxpayers in disaster areas to timing relief under section 7508a(d), the commenter noted that there would be a dramatic increase in the number of disasters leading to postponements of time-sensitive tax acts. on these issues, the third commenter concluded that the proposed regulations properly preserved the discretion of the irs to determine which declared disasters should result in any type of disaster relief and of which time-sensitive tax acts should be postponed under section 7508a. the comments from the first two commenters on this issue are not adopted in the final regulations, while the approving comments of the third commenter were already reflected in the proposed regulations. as explained more fully in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part i. time-sensitive tax acts, and as noted by the third commenter described above, except for the rules regarding pensions described in section 7508a(d)(4), section 7508a(d), by its terms, does not specify the time-sensitive tax acts to be postponed during the mandatory 60-day postponement period. instead, section 7508a(d)(1) provides that the mandatory 60-day postponement period ``shall be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' section 7508a(a) is not self-executing, but rather, requires a determination by the secretary to specify the acts to be postponed. as a result, the cross-reference to section 7508a(a) in section 7508a(d)(1) operates to require the same determination by the secretary as a prerequisite to determining the acts to which the mandatory 60-day postponement period applies. this interpretation gives full effect to the statutory language and does not reduce section 7508a(d) to a nullity, because that section still imposes a mandatory period for postponement and establishes a new category of persons eligible for reliefthe ``qualified taxpayers'' defined in section 7508a(d)(2). the final regulations make no changes to sec. 301.7508a- 1(g)(1) and (2) of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i) section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i) of the proposed regulations tracked section 7508a(d)(1) and (d)(5) in describing how the mandatory 60-day postponement period for federally declared disasters will be calculated and how the calculation of that mandatory postponement period will interact with the secretary's discretionary postponement period (if any) under section 7508a(a) and (b). the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part ii. calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period, identified a 120-day postponement period from the beginning incident date of a disaster announced by fema as the usual postponement period provided by the irs for those disasters where the irs exercises its discretion under section 7508a(a) or (b) to postpone any time-sensitive tax acts. consequently, most mandatory 60-day postponement periods under section 7508a(d) will be calculated to run concurrently with the 120- day postponement period the irs generally provides under section 7508a(a) or (b). two commenters noted that section 7508a(d)(1) and the proposed regulations did not provide a clear rule for calculating the mandatory 60-day postponement period when there was more than one disaster declaration issued for the same disaster in a particular state or when any disaster declaration was amended to provide any new or modified incident dates (earliest or latest) that were missing or different from when the first disaster declaration for a disaster in a state was announced by fema. two commenters suggested potential alternative methods of making calculations of the mandatory 60-day postponement period more certain when there are multiple disaster declarations or disaster declarations that are amended by fema for the earliest or latest incident dates described in section 7508a(d)(1)(a) and (b). one commenter claimed that a literal reading of section 7508a(d)(1) creates challenges for indefinite disasters, such as the covid-19 pandemic, because the statute could be interpreted to postpone a taxpayer's deadlines ``indefinitely until some unknown point in time that is long after the disaster began.'' to avoid this ``unworkable application'' of the statute, this commenter recommended that if the initial disaster declaration does not expressly identify the latest incident date for a disaster, then section 7508a(d) should be interpreted as automatically providing a postponement period until the date that is 60 days after the earliest incident date specified in a disaster declaration. however, the statute mitigates the commenter's concern by directing that the postponement period under section 7508a(d) ``shall be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under subsection (a).'' that provision ensures that the secretary retains the same discretion as she has under section 7508a(a) to determine what time-sensitive tax acts, if any, will be postponed. a second commenter noted what it characterized as a pick-and-choose problem and an amendment problem with the method of calculating the mandatory 60-day postponement period provided for in the proposed regulations and recommended the secretary adopt one of several alternative bright-line rules it suggested for making the calculation period more predictable. this second commenter noted there was a potential pick-and-choose problem among multiple potential fema-announced disaster declarations, because the treasury department and the irs propose to treat fema- announced emergency declarations (as well as major disaster declarations) under the stafford act as federally declared disasters under sections 165 and 7508a of the code. this commenter's recommendation to strike proposed amended regulation sec. 1.165- 11(b)(1) is discussed and rejected in the preamble discussion of this issue above. alternatively, the second commenter recommended that the final regulations reflect a bright-line rule to address potential multiple declarations, such as a first-out rule (the first issued declaration controls), a rule that a later major disaster declaration controls over an earlier emergency declaration, or a rule that the issue date of an emergency declaration is the earliest incident date for section 7508a(d)(1)'s mandatory 60-day postponement period. the second commenter further recommended in this section of the final regulations that the treasury department and the irs provide a bright-line rule concerning the effect of potential amendments to an initial fema announced disaster declaration on how the mandatory 60-day postponement period is calculated. the additional potential bright-line alternatives suggested by the second commenter were that (i) future amendments will not affect how the mandatory period is calculated, or (ii) only amendments made within a certain amount of time (say one year) will affect the computation of the mandatory period. the treasury department and the irs appreciate the predictability offered by the bright-line rules suggested by the second commenter. nevertheless, the statutory language providing for a mandatory period beginning on the earliest incident date specified in the disaster declaration and ending on the date which is 60 days after the latest incident date so specified is capable of being applied as written. while amendments to disaster declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates can cause confusion, the intent of the statute is to ensure that relief is provided throughout the disaster period, assuming such a period is identified in the disaster declaration and the secretary has determined that postponement of time-sensitive tax acts is warranted. as a result, the comment on this issue is not adopted in the final regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(ii)(a) the proposed regulations provided that in no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year. one commenter stated that this portion of the proposed regulations should be removed because it lacks any basis in the text or legislative history of section 7508a(d)(1) or (d)(4). the comment on this issue is not adopted in the final regulations. as stated in the explanation of provisions section of the preamble to the proposed regulations, part ii. calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period, it defies logic for the secretary's discretionary postponement period under section 7508a(a) to be limited to ``a period of up to 1 year,'' and there be no limit on the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508a(d). interpreting section 7508a(d) to allow postponement periods for more than 1 year would be contrary to the directive of section 7508a(d)(1) that the mandatory 60- day postponement period must ``be disregarded in the same manner as a period specified under [section 7508a(a)].'' the final regulations make no change to sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(ii)(a) of the proposed regulations. section 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii) example (3) the proposed regulations provided an example (3) concerning a continuing disaster declaration involving wildfires that was later amended by a subsequent fema announcement of a latest incident date for the disaster. this example contained typographical errors, including a misnumbering``(5)'' instead of ``(4)''of the subparagraph for the four examples and referring to the taxpayer in the example variously as ``individual c'' and ``individual d.'' one commenter further noted that the intended rules, if any, which example (3) was meant to illustrate were not described in the portions of the proposed regulations which precede the examples section. example (3) is intended to illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period in the event of an ongoing disaster with multiple declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates described in sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3) of these final regulations. the treasury department and the irs have modified example (3) in these final regulations, in consideration of the comment above as well as the comments received on sec. 301.7508a-1(g)(3)(i), to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period and to correct typographical errors. section 301.7508a-1(h)(2) the proposed regulations provided that the final regulations shall apply to all disasters declared on or after december 21, 2019. one commenter requested not only that the final regulations not be retroactive to the effective date of section 7508a(d), but that the final regulations provide relief to any individuals or employee benefit plans that took actions (or failed to take actions) based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the postponement relief provided in section 7508a. the commenter further requested that such good faith relief be available for at least 60 days after the final regulations are published in the federal register. the applicability date discussion in the preamble to the proposed regulations clearly indicated the intention of the treasury department and the irs to rely on the provisions of section 7805(b)(2) of the code for the applicability date of these final regulations. section 7805(b)(2) provides that regulations filed or issued within 18 months of the date of enactment of the statutory provision to which the regulations relate are not prohibited from applying retroactively to the date of enactment. section 7508a(d) was enacted on december 20, 2019, and these final regulations have been filed or issued within 18 months of that date of enactment. the proposed regulations were clear in stating that the treasury department and the irs intended for the final regulations to apply to any disasters that were declared on or after december 21, 2019. these final regulations do not adopt the commenter's request to modify sec. 301.7508a-1(h)(2) of the proposed regulations. new rule proposal one commenter requested that the final regulations ``confirm'' that all forms of deadline relief requested under section 7508a are optional for affected taxpayers. in particular, the commenter focused on deadlines arising under employee benefit plans. in some cases, the application of these deadlines may affect both the plan and the participants. after consideration, the treasury department and the irs have concluded that the suggestions made in this comment are beyond the intended scope of the proposed regulations. consequently, the suggestions are not adopted in these final regulations. modifications of proposed regulations section 301.7508a-1(g)(4)(iii) example (3) example (3) is modified to better illustrate the calculation of the mandatory 60-day postponement period in the event of multiple declarations and shifting ``latest'' incident dates, and to correct typographical errors. applicability dates for date of applicability for the amendment to the procedure and administration regulations under section 7508a, see sec. 301.7508a- 1(h), which provides that the regulations promulgated by this treasury decision are applicable for federally declared disasters that are declared on or after december 21, 2019, as explained in the preamble to the proposed regulations (reg-115057-20) published in the federal register (86 fr 2607), because section 7805(b)(2) of the internal revenue code (code) provides that regulations filed or issued within 18 months of the date of the enactment of the statutory provision to which they relate may apply to taxable periods prior to those described in section 7805(b)(1) and these final regulations are being published within 18 months of the enactment of section 7508a(d) on december 20, 2019. the date of applicability for the amendment to the income tax regulations under section 165 of the code to clarify the definition of the term ``federally declared disaster'' is june 11, 2021. special analyses certain irs regulations, including these, are exempt from the requirements of executive order 12866, as supplemented and affirmed by executive order 13563. therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. pursuant to the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6), it is hereby certified that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. the regulations clarify how the secretary may postpone certain time- sensitive tax deadlines by reason of a federally declared disaster. such postponements provide more time for affected taxpayers to complete time-sensitive acts than they otherwise would have under the internal revenue laws. in addition, the regulations do not impose a collection of information burden on any person, including small entities, for purposes of the regulatory flexibility act (5 you.s.c. chapter 6). accordingly, the secretary certifies that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. pursuant to section 7805(f) of the internal revenue code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these final regulations was submitted to the chief counsel for advocacy of the small business administration for comments on its impact on small business, and no comments were received. drafting information the principal authors of these final regulations are andrew c. keaton and william v. spatz of the office of associate chief counsel (procedure and administration). however, other personnel from the treasury department and the irs participated in their development. list of subjects 26 cfr part 1 income taxes, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 26 cfr part 301 employment taxes,

(2) paragraph (b)(1) of this section. the second sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to elections and revocations that are made on or after june 11, 2021. part 301procedure and administration 0 par. 3. the authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows: authority: 26 you.s.c. 78050 par. 4. section 301.7508a-1 is amended by revising paragraph (g) and adding paragraph (h) to read as follows: sec. 301.7508a-1 postponement of certain tax-related deadlines by reasons of a federally declared disaster or terroristic or military action.(g) mandatory 60-day postponement(1) in general. in addition to (or concurrent with) the postponement period specified by the secretary in an exercise of the authority under section 7508a(a) to postpone time-sensitive acts by reason of a federally declared disaster, qualified taxpayers (as defined in section 7508a(d)(2)) are entitled to a mandatory 60-day postponement period during which the time to perform those time-sensitive acts is disregarded in the same manner as under section 7508a(a). the rules of this paragraph (g)(1) apply with respect to a postponement period specified by the secretary under section 7508a(b), to postpone acts as provided in section 7508a(d)(4). except for the acts set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, section 7508a(d) does not apply to postpone any acts. (2) acts postponed. the time-sensitive acts that are postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period are the acts determined to be postponed by the secretary's exercise of authority under section 7508a(a) or (b). in addition, in the case of any person described in section 7508a(b), the time-sensitive acts postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period include those described in section 7508a(d)(4): (i) making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within the meaning of section 4974(c)) under section 219(f)(3), 404(a)(6), 404(h)(1)(b), or 404(m)(2); (ii) making distributions under section 408(d)(4); (iii) recharacterizing contributions under section 408a(d)(6); and (iv) making a rollover under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3).

(ii) limitations on the mandatory 60-day postponement period. (a) in no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year. (b) in the event the secretary determines to postpone time- sensitive acts pursuant to a declaration establishing a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508a that does not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508a(d). in such cases, the only postponement period will be the period determined by the secretary under section 7508a(a) or (b). (4) examples. the rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples: (i) example (1). individual a lives in a state that experienced severe but isolated tornado damage on march 15. on march 20, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president for the state where individual a lives, describing the incident date for the tornado as march 15. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs published a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from march 15 through july 31, pursuant to section 7508a(a). the county where individual a lives was included in the news release. under section 7508a(d), the mandatory 60-day postponement period that individual a is entitled to begins on march 15 and ends 60 days after march 15, on may 14. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual a under section 7508a(a). (ii) example (2). individual b lives in a coastal state which experienced harmful effects from a hurricane that began to affect the weather in his state on august 15 and ceased to be a weather factor in his state on august 19. on august 22, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president, determining that the coastline counties in the state, including the county where individual b lives, were severely affected and that these counties were entitled to both individual assistance and public assistance. the major disaster declaration specified the earliest incident date for the hurricane in the state where individual b lives as august 15 and the latest incident date as august 19. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs published a news release identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from august 15 through december 31, pursuant to section 7508a(a). under section 7508a(d), the mandatory 60- day postponement period that individual b is entitled to begins on august 15 and ends 60 days after august 19, on october 18. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual b under section 7508a(a). (iii) example (3). individual c lives in a county of a state that is experiencing ongoing wildfires. on august 14, fema issued a federal register notice announcing an emergency declaration approved by the president to make public assistance available under the stafford act to local governments to fight the wildfires. this declaration specified an earliest incident date of august 14 and no latest incident date. on august 17, fema issued a federal register notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the president for the same wildfires incident, announcing that the residents of the county where individual c lives were eligible to receive individual assistance under the stafford act. this declaration specified august 15 as the earliest incident date and described the incident period as ongoing. based upon that major disaster declaration, the irs exercised its discretion under section 7508a(a) to publish a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the wildfires disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying both the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from august 15 through december 15. following the initial news release, the wildfires disaster remained ongoing, with no ending incident date specified, for several months. the irs published a second news release postponing the time-sensitive acts through january 15. fema subsequently amended the major disaster declaration to specify the latest incident date of november 19. because the irs acted in its discretion to provide relief in response to the major disaster declaration, and not to provide relief in response to the emergency declaration, the mandatory 60-day postponement period that individual c is entitled to under section 7508a(d) begins on august 15, the earliest incident date specified in the major disaster declaration, and ends 60 days after the latest incident date of november 19. the mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the irs provided to individual c under section 7508a(a), and ends on january 18, which is 60 days after the latest incident date and three days beyond the postponement period specified by the irs under section 7508a(a) in its news release. (iv) example (4). individual d lives in the united states, which is experiencing a nationwide emergency as a result of its residents being exposed to a highly infectious and dangerous pandemic disease. on march 13, the president declared a nationwide emergency under section 501(b) of the stafford act. the pandemic became a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508a on march 13, however, no incident date was specified in the president's emergency declaration. pursuant to the president's march 13 emergency declaration, the irs published several notices identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508a and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement that generally ran from april 1 through july 15, pursuant to section 7508a(a). because, in this circumstance, the emergency declaration pursuant to which the notices were published did not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508a(d). the only postponement period is the period determined by the secretary pursuant to the discretionary authority under section 7508a(a). (h) applicability dates(1) in general. except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to disasters declared after january 15, 2009. (2) paragraph (g) of this section. paragraph (g) of this section applies to disasters declared on or after december 21, 2019. douglas w. o'donnell, deputy commissioner for services and enforcement. approved: may 25, 2021. mark j. mazur, assistant secretary of the treasury (tax policy).
